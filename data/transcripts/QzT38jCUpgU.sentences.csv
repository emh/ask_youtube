QzT38jCUpgU,0,Hello - everyone Peter zein here coming to you from Colorado
QzT38jCUpgU,1,"I hope everyone had a great Thanksgiving and I hope it kicked off a fantastic holiday season for everyone holiday Christmas, Hanukkah ones, whatever you call it, whatever makes you happy just that's somebody else's culture, War issue uh"
QzT38jCUpgU,2,"Today, we're going to talk about something significantly more significant sure, and that is the end of China, which is moving out of the realm of the theoretical and the historic into the Here and Now"
QzT38jCUpgU,3,"What'S going on right now is there are protests involving thousands of people against the government that are at least nominally about covid restrictions? Now ostensively, there have been two triggers for these sort of mass core semi-coordinated protests"
QzT38jCUpgU,4,"The first was a fire that occurred in the western city of arumchi that killed people who were undercovered quarantine according to Chinese laws when it comes to quarantine, people can't move, and it doesn't matter if your building's on fire - and it also meant that the fire surfaces Couldn'T get into the building to do battle with the fire? Anyway, it's policy in China to weld people into their homes and their buildings when they're under quarantine, so toss in a fire and shrug second, the World Cup"
QzT38jCUpgU,5,"China is an information State, and part of that means that the state lies to you about anything"
QzT38jCUpgU,6,It finds inconvenient like the fact that most of the world has found a way to move on from covid
QzT38jCUpgU,7,"Well, the World Cup's live broadcasts showed tens of thousands of cheering and buoying fans without masks and well folks got cheesed off"
QzT38jCUpgU,8,So we now have protests in every major city
QzT38jCUpgU,9,"The overall number is at least in the high tens of thousands of people participating and it's difficult to know more detail than that, because it's an information State"
QzT38jCUpgU,10,"China is a bit of a black box for policy, because China is a one-man state, but that one-man state is becoming overwhelmed with non-compliance and the government just doesn't have the bandwidth to come up with policies that most people would consider normal"
QzT38jCUpgU,11,But I think the best word we can use here is creative
QzT38jCUpgU,12,"One person only has so much bandwidth and so we're seeing institutional freezing and breakdown, because this this isn't the United States, where a bunch of suburban Housewives to send a masculus on a food court and start yelling"
QzT38jCUpgU,13,Let'S go Brandon or a few yahoos glue themselves to a museum wall
QzT38jCUpgU,14,"We can obviously get through crap like that, but it isn't clear that China can"
QzT38jCUpgU,15,It has to do with a different structure
QzT38jCUpgU,16,"The United States has different levels of authority, local State, national legislative, judicial, executive, neighborhood, business, academic and so on, independently garnered, constitutionally garnered Community created overlapping, sometimes clashing often messy, but interests generate power generates Authority generates durability, not in China"
QzT38jCUpgU,17,China is a one-man State because it is nearly the only way that China can exist
QzT38jCUpgU,18,"This isn't Sweden or Denmark or France, or Argentina or Korea, where the bulk of Economic and political power exists in one city"
QzT38jCUpgU,19,So it's easy to come to a degree of consensus
QzT38jCUpgU,20,"China'S population is spread out on a huge swath of territory comprising everything from near Arctic to fully tropical and Regional disparities abound, as you would expect, but this also isn't the United States, where our definition of inequality means that the average person in Maryland is about twice As wealthy as an average person in West Virginia, China's Regional disparities are a ten to one span"
QzT38jCUpgU,21,"Nor is this a country like Germany or the us, or Japan, or India or Indonesia, where geography was kind enough to enable physical integration via either waterways or easily maintained Road and rail networks, and so where you have integration, you have commonality, never had that in China"
QzT38jCUpgU,22,The North China Plain is its own region
QzT38jCUpgU,23,"The Yangtze Basin is an industrial Powerhouse with few connections to the North, and the cities of the southern coast have always looked abroad for their welfare, their safety and even their food"
QzT38jCUpgU,24,"The only way to make China work is to force it to, and these many disconnects show up in Chinese institutions"
QzT38jCUpgU,25,"The Chinese Constitution is a joke, it isn't even referenced by Chinese courts, there's no rule of law, there is law by rule and not rule is whatever ji, the chairman says, and he is a horrible delegator"
QzT38jCUpgU,26,"Even within the Chinese Communist Party, the coveted restrictions in play right now are part of that milieu"
QzT38jCUpgU,27,"They all draw their Authority and power, not So Much from the Communist party or the Chinese state, but from XI"
QzT38jCUpgU,28,"Personally, that's how you get neighborhood HOAs enforcing covid lockdowns"
QzT38jCUpgU,29,"So brutal that fire escapes are welded shut to ensure enforcement, ensuring that people die in easily preventable tragedies like what happened at a room sheet or city authorities, thinking that they're doing the will of XI and by and removing street signs with the word Emoji in them"
QzT38jCUpgU,30,"Because they assume that's what G wants in order to smother citizen awareness, if we see meaningful resistance to any Chinese policy, China goes one of two directions: option one you get a rolling series of government breakdowns as Jesus Authority is challenged and there's no one to step In to replace it because he has purged the system, so completely covet is only one Chinese policy that feels a bit out of place"
QzT38jCUpgU,31,"What about the social monitoring system that has created an information State tighter than Cold War? East Germany? What about lending controls that have contributed to real estate distortions, two orders of magnitude larger than America's subprime? What about laws against the vpms that allow you to share your kids photos without them being entered into a National Database? What about the deliberate cultural destruction, policies for the uyghurs and Tibetans, a kraken, she's personal Authority isn't simply a crack in the facade, but a fissure to the core, which would unleash a torrent of dissent that would wash away everything we're already seeing the protests spread to Non-Related issues University students are getting in on it"
QzT38jCUpgU,32,"Opinions are being aired on dictatorship versus democracy, economic growth, housing how good or how bad a job she personally is doing in a country where any sort of common, coordinated public outcry is used, viewed as treason"
QzT38jCUpgU,33,We are already hip deep or there's always option b
QzT38jCUpgU,34,She puts a stop to it
QzT38jCUpgU,35,"She is a child of the cultural revolution, a 10-year, long, internal repression, so intense it killed at least 40 million people and gutted what then pass for the Chinese economy"
QzT38jCUpgU,36,"Neither of these are great options, but both of them are emblematic of the long run of Chinese history, either China becomes too tightly wound and controlled, and it descends into an orgy of self-destruction or Central Authority breaks and China spins apart in an orgy of self-destruction and Just in case you haven't been paying attention"
QzT38jCUpgU,37,"Neither of these outcomes are particularly good for business, we're now at a point where it's not so much that if you wanted to divest away from China, it's too late to do so in a way that enables you to salvage your facility"
QzT38jCUpgU,38,We probably passed that point over the summer now
QzT38jCUpgU,39,"The issue is that if you lack an evacuation plan for your key employees, you might not be able to get them out at all, and just so no one overlooks the other issue"
QzT38jCUpgU,40,"China'S domestically generated, coveted vaccines, don't work against Omicron and previous lockdowns within China have kept covid out of the general population, so very few Chinese have any natural resistance, and now now China has already experienced several days of mass super spreader events"
QzT38jCUpgU,41,"China has higher rates of diabetes than the United States, and China's Health Care system is absolutely atrocious"
QzT38jCUpgU,42,"It is difficult to put into words which part of what is about to happen is worse for the People's Republic, so everyone have a great holiday season and I'll see you soon"
QzT38jCUpgU,43,"Bye,"
