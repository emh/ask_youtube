j8TLGaSPOzY,0,"Hey everyone here, Peter zein, coming toyou from Colorado with part four of ourUkraine implications Series today we'regoing to be talking about what thismeans for American operational strategyas opposed to kind of our grandgeopoliticswhat"
j8TLGaSPOzY,1,We'Re seeing in Ukraine is apotential model for how the UnitedStates will fight Wars
j8TLGaSPOzY,2,"For the nextdecade or two one of the many many manymanyconsequences of the 20 years of theglobal war on terror is that theAmericans for the moment, are pretty muchdone"
j8TLGaSPOzY,3,"We'Re not going to be deployingtroops in number anywhere in the worldas, a tripwire or as a major Forcedesigned to overthrow a government andremake it into whatever image we see: fitit's bloody, the first part knocking offthe government"
j8TLGaSPOzY,4,"That'S the easy part andthen dealing, what happens with the nextday"
j8TLGaSPOzY,5,"The next month, the next year, thenext decade, that sucks and as we havediscovered with over a hundred thousandtroops and trillions of dollars, ofinvestment in Afghanistan and Iraqwe, are left with a broken nation and anation"
j8TLGaSPOzY,6,"That is, I don't want to callpathologically hostile, but not very fondabout"
j8TLGaSPOzY,7,"The United States about anythinguh it didn't work, uh, and so the UnitedStates needs a different method and inthat method"
j8TLGaSPOzY,8,The Army is no longer anoption in terms of ground deployment
j8TLGaSPOzY,9,"Wewill use the Army if we are faced with astrategic threat, but regardless of whatyou say about how we did Iraq andAfghanistan, I don't think any of usreally thought of the two countriesthemselves as strategic threats"
j8TLGaSPOzY,10,"Theremay have been elements within them: likeAl Qaeda that required getting knockedoff, but to say that that required, ahundred thousand troops"
j8TLGaSPOzY,11,"No, no thehundred thousand troops went to try toreshape the local space so that a futurestrategic threat would not arise and inthat the war on terror was a failure"
j8TLGaSPOzY,12,Soukraine
j8TLGaSPOzY,13,"Here we have a highly motivatedcountry of about 40 million people, whois standing up to a nearly as motivatedcountry of roughly 135-145 millionRussian members who knows and all theyrequire is every bullet and drop of fuelthat"
j8TLGaSPOzY,14,They need to prosecute a warso
j8TLGaSPOzY,15,"What we're seeing is the UnitedStates has identified a strategic threatRussia and is using a local power tofight the war with American Technicaland Industrial infrastructure, so weprovide the equipment, but it's more thanthat"
j8TLGaSPOzY,16,The technical side of things
j8TLGaSPOzY,17,Theunited States has the most sophisticatedsatellite monitoring system in the worldI'd
j8TLGaSPOzY,18,"Argue it's better than everyoneelse's, combined by a significant marginprobably, a factor of four or fiveand"
j8TLGaSPOzY,19,"We are providing Time On Targetinformation for the ukrainians, to launchartillery and Rocket strikes on targetsthat are Miles tens of miles away"
j8TLGaSPOzY,20,Andthose rockets and artillery shells arehitting within a few feet of wherethey're aimed at you
j8TLGaSPOzY,21,"You can't do thatwith, just the normal equipment, even ifwe didn't have kill switches in all ofour gear and for the most part we dowithout actively tapping the Americansatellite and Information Networkeven"
j8TLGaSPOzY,22,"If the ukrainians could fire thesethings on their own, they wouldn't beable to hit the targets that they'rehitting they wouldn't be able toidentify them"
j8TLGaSPOzY,23,"That requires a degree ofAmerican involvement, but not a degree"
j8TLGaSPOzY,24,Ofamerican involvement in Ukraineso there's a whole kill chain here
j8TLGaSPOzY,25,Onceyou identify the target
j8TLGaSPOzY,26,"You have to getthat information to a weapon system thatis in range, along with the coordinatesand, the guidance information, so thatweapon systems can actually Hit theTarget in the past that kill chain hasbeen, measured in hoursone of the many many things that we'veseen as a result of improved informationtechnology"
j8TLGaSPOzY,27,"In just the last three orfour years is reducing that kill changein just a few minutes, and this whenAmerican operators are not the ones whoare using the equipment within the endcountry"
j8TLGaSPOzY,28,"This is the model for the futuretaking weapon systems that for the mostpart, the United States, considersrelatively, low Tech and relativelyoutdated transferring them to a thirdcountry that is fighting a war that wefind to be in our strategic interestsnow"
j8TLGaSPOzY,29,"I'M sure people are going to hearthat statement like oh, of course, theAmericans baited, the Russians"
j8TLGaSPOzY,30,"No, no I'msorrythe Russians required no baiting tolaunch an imperialistic fascistgenocidal War"
j8TLGaSPOzY,31,They did that all on theirown uh
j8TLGaSPOzY,32,"This, I would underline, is one ofthe reasons, one of the many many manyreasons"
j8TLGaSPOzY,33,"Why the United States and theRussians have not seen eye to eye sinceWorld War II uh, because their method, offighting a war, is just something we finduh morally repugnant and at least astrategically distasteful anyway, back tothe, more important, topicthis sort of conflict is something thatcan be leveraged at Scale at any givenmoment there are dozens of operativeswithin, the Ukrainian system, that areinterfacing with the Americanequivalents back in the United States, orin NATO countries providing thisreal-time information and providingroughly 80 to 90 percent of thetechnical steps of the entire kill chaindoing it"
j8TLGaSPOzY,34,This way make sure that the wargets steered in directions that youthink are productive and not ones thatare damaging to your interests
j8TLGaSPOzY,35,"Thisisn'T World War II, when we wereproviding the Soviets with artillery andshells and fuel because they would usethem"
j8TLGaSPOzY,36,"However, they felt was appropriatein this case"
j8TLGaSPOzY,37,If there's a specifictactical Target that we don't want theukrainians to hit no number one wewouldn't tell them about it
j8TLGaSPOzY,38,Number twowe wouldn't provide the Strategicguidance
j8TLGaSPOzY,39,Excuse me the tacticalinformation that is required for them
j8TLGaSPOzY,40,"Totarget those thingsso one of the very, very few scenariosthat I can see where nuclear weaponscould come into play in the Ukraine warwould be"
j8TLGaSPOzY,41,"If the ukrainians decide tocross the border into Russia, proper thatthey've just experienced such runawaysuccess, they decided to go for the goldwell"
j8TLGaSPOzY,42,They can't do that without AmericanGear and the American Gear cannot beused in the way that it's being used inUkraine right now without activeAmerican participation
j8TLGaSPOzY,43,So we do not needto worry about the ukrainiansgetting ahead of themselvesunless
j8TLGaSPOzY,44,We decide
j8TLGaSPOzY,45,We want to empower themto
j8TLGaSPOzY,46,"Do so, and I can't imagine that isgoing to happenyou can apply this model to any placewhere"
j8TLGaSPOzY,47,You'Ve got a numerically Superiorfoe who has some logistical concerns
j8TLGaSPOzY,48,Ican see this working great in Korea orTaiwan
j8TLGaSPOzY,49,I can see this working with Egyptany place where there are foes
j8TLGaSPOzY,50,"Nearbythat can't be handled unless you canprovide mid to long range strikecapability with precision and if you cando, that the math changesthe other side of the equation - thatwe're not seeing in Ukraine, but we willsee else Blair Are Special Operationsforces"
j8TLGaSPOzY,51,"Now, Navy Seals Army Rangers CIAthat sort of thing where you take a fewsmall teams, usually numbering fewer than100 people and throw them Behind EnemyLines or you have them directlyinterfacing with allies in order to getmore bang for the bucknow in the global war and Terror, ourSpecial Operation Forces Operated withlocal groups like the Kurds or theHazara uh in Afghanistan in order tokind of bring in American airstrikesbasically, you travel with a team forprotection and for getting the local layof the land, identifying targets and thenyou called on airstrikes that'll stillcontinue, but one of the things we'reseeing with Uh, the better artillery andRocket coordination is this going tohappen to multiple levels, the the reasonthat the Special Operation Forces arenot active in Ukraine is because Ukrainehas nukes and if you put American bootson the ground, those nukes might comeinto play and that's something we'rereally trying to avoidbut"
j8TLGaSPOzY,52,You could do that versus Syriareally easily
j8TLGaSPOzY,53,"Now the Syrian rebels arenot benefiting large-scale from AmericanEquipment, because we don't want to pissoff turkey, but I can see based oncertain circumstancesthose alliances shiftingand if you get the Kurds running aroundwith some hammars well, that would be areal problem for Damascus"
j8TLGaSPOzY,54,"So these arethe two pillars of American strategicpolicy in the future working throughthird parties, fully leveraging Americanindustrial infrastructure and Technicalcapacity and on the other side for amore, pointed application"
j8TLGaSPOzY,55,"Specialoperation Forces doing a lot ofdisruptions, either Behind Enemy Lines, orin terms, ofacting sort of like a guidance counselorfor militant groups that are already inthe regionthis is going to last"
j8TLGaSPOzY,56,"Until such time, asthe United States has gotten over itsgun shy period whenever we have a bigmilitary conflict, especially if itdoesn't go well"
j8TLGaSPOzY,57,We take a breather
j8TLGaSPOzY,58,Andwe have to kind of reintegrate themilitary with Society to the point
j8TLGaSPOzY,59,Thatwe are willing to send the tens ofthousands
j8TLGaSPOzY,60,"Hundreds of thousands oftroops abroad again that is not going tohappen to the United States, I wouldguess before 2040"
j8TLGaSPOzY,61,""
j8TLGaSPOzY,62,So this is the futureof American intervention for at leastthe next 18 yearsand as we're seeing in Ukraine it'sdefinitely a model that works okaythat's it for me until next time
j8TLGaSPOzY,63,""
