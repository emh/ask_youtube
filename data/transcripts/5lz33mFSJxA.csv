5lz33mFSJxA,0,2159,hey Peter zein here coming to you from
5lz33mFSJxA,2159,4200,the Front Range Foothills outside of
5lz33mFSJxA,4200,7620,Denver today I wanted to talk about a
5lz33mFSJxA,7620,9840,big issue that is making the rounds in
5lz33mFSJxA,9840,12120,Europe when the bite Administration
5lz33mFSJxA,12120,14240,repackaged some of his green
5lz33mFSJxA,14240,16740,pro-american manufacturing programs into
5lz33mFSJxA,16740,19260,the inflation reduction act it really
5lz33mFSJxA,19260,21240,rubbed the Europeans the wrong way
5lz33mFSJxA,21240,23100,because here we have this massive
5lz33mFSJxA,23100,25019,stimulus program that is specifically
5lz33mFSJxA,25019,27359,designed to restore manufacturing to
5lz33mFSJxA,27359,29099,North America so foreign companies need
5lz33mFSJxA,29099,32578,not apply it's basically just for
5lz33mFSJxA,32578,34860,manufacturing build out in the United
5lz33mFSJxA,34860,36420,States for American workers on American
5lz33mFSJxA,36420,38640,soil with American Capital and the
5lz33mFSJxA,38640,40140,Europeans see that as a violation of
5lz33mFSJxA,40140,41640,free trade rules and you can make the
5lz33mFSJxA,41640,43260,argument that there's a legal case to be
5lz33mFSJxA,43260,44579,had there they're starting to threaten
5lz33mFSJxA,44579,46739,WTO action and the Biden Administration
5lz33mFSJxA,46739,49140,is like tough the bite Administration is
5lz33mFSJxA,49140,50640,definitely going to get its way on this
5lz33mFSJxA,50640,52500,a few things to kind of keep in the back
5lz33mFSJxA,52500,53940,of your mind when you're evaluating
5lz33mFSJxA,53940,55379,things like this
5lz33mFSJxA,55379,58620,first of all this is a political project
5lz33mFSJxA,58620,60239,just like everything else and the bite
5lz33mFSJxA,60239,62760,Administration sees this as a way of
5lz33mFSJxA,62760,66540,getting its hooks back into the uh the
5lz33mFSJxA,66540,67860,voting faction that we all know is
5lz33mFSJxA,67860,70500,organized labor now organized labor is
5lz33mFSJxA,70500,72000,one of those political factions that is
5lz33mFSJxA,72000,73560,in play between the Republicans and the
5lz33mFSJxA,73560,75180,Democrats right now so throwing a
5lz33mFSJxA,75180,76979,trillion dollars their way is going to
5lz33mFSJxA,76979,79020,go a long way and since this is the
5lz33mFSJxA,79020,80460,future of the democratic party that
5lz33mFSJxA,80460,82200,Biden is concerned about don't expect
5lz33mFSJxA,82200,84000,him to back down
5lz33mFSJxA,84000,85799,second there's a broader strategic
5lz33mFSJxA,85799,87180,picture here
5lz33mFSJxA,87180,90119,part of the whole idea of the globalized
5lz33mFSJxA,90119,91979,order that the United States created at
5lz33mFSJxA,91979,94619,the end of World War II was that if you
5lz33mFSJxA,94619,96600,let us write your security policies
5lz33mFSJxA,96600,98280,vis-a-vis the Soviet Union in the Cold
5lz33mFSJxA,98280,100680,War then we will use our Navy to
5lz33mFSJxA,100680,102540,guarantee your Commerce no matter where
5lz33mFSJxA,102540,104040,it goes and we will allow you near
5lz33mFSJxA,104040,105600,duty-free access into the American
5lz33mFSJxA,105600,108000,market and you do not have to grant us
5lz33mFSJxA,108000,110700,reciprocal access and that in many ways
5lz33mFSJxA,110700,112380,is the economic foundation of the
5lz33mFSJxA,112380,114540,entirety of the European Union so the
5lz33mFSJxA,114540,115979,Europeans have been thinking this way
5lz33mFSJxA,115979,118799,now since 1945 but the cold war ended
5lz33mFSJxA,118799,121380,back in 1989 and the Americans have been
5lz33mFSJxA,121380,122820,moving away from it incrementally ever
5lz33mFSJxA,122820,124079,since
5lz33mFSJxA,124079,126420,Obama was very populous Trump was more
5lz33mFSJxA,126420,128280,populous Biden was the most populous we
5lz33mFSJxA,128280,129660,have now had three presidents in a row
5lz33mFSJxA,129660,131819,that from a foreign economic point of
5lz33mFSJxA,131819,134459,view have had exactly the same policy
5lz33mFSJxA,134459,136860,with different levels of attention and
5lz33mFSJxA,136860,138720,different levels of grammar checking so
5lz33mFSJxA,138720,140400,if you're an ideologue suck on that for
5lz33mFSJxA,140400,141300,a little bit I'm sure it's really
5lz33mFSJxA,141300,143340,uncomfortable but the bottom line is the
5lz33mFSJxA,143340,145800,American political system no longer
5lz33mFSJxA,145800,148560,subscribes to this guns and butter trade
5lz33mFSJxA,148560,150720,deal that we had that dates back 75
5lz33mFSJxA,150720,153060,years now so the Europeans are now
5lz33mFSJxA,153060,155459,having to deal with a More Level Playing
5lz33mFSJxA,155459,156660,Field and they find it very
5lz33mFSJxA,156660,157920,uncomfortable
5lz33mFSJxA,157920,160020,third the Europeans have been doing this
5lz33mFSJxA,160020,162480,a long time part of part of the order is
5lz33mFSJxA,162480,165239,that access was only one way and so the
5lz33mFSJxA,165239,167160,Europeans are among the more subsidized
5lz33mFSJxA,167160,169379,manufacturing sectors in the world with
5lz33mFSJxA,169379,172140,States stepping in regularly to bail out
5lz33mFSJxA,172140,174780,or reinforce various economic sectors
5lz33mFSJxA,174780,177060,across the entire system in many ways
5lz33mFSJxA,177060,178319,what the Biden Administration doing
5lz33mFSJxA,178319,180239,right now is what Europe has been doing
5lz33mFSJxA,180239,182879,for 75 years and so Biden's General
5lz33mFSJxA,182879,184739,position is you can suck it
5lz33mFSJxA,184739,187379,and then finally let's assume for the
5lz33mFSJxA,187379,189060,moment that the bide Administration was
5lz33mFSJxA,189060,192120,fine subsidizing European workers in
5lz33mFSJxA,192120,194459,order to service the American Market
5lz33mFSJxA,194459,197159,it wouldn't work anymore anyway one of
5lz33mFSJxA,197159,199739,the many many side effects of the
5lz33mFSJxA,199739,202140,Ukraine war is that natural gas flows to
5lz33mFSJxA,202140,203640,Europe have been circumscribed and
5lz33mFSJxA,203640,204540,eventually they're just going to
5lz33mFSJxA,204540,207420,collapse completely we are already at a
5lz33mFSJxA,207420,208980,point when there are a lot of economic
5lz33mFSJxA,208980,210840,sectors especially industrial sectors in
5lz33mFSJxA,210840,213060,Europe that are no longer viable at all
5lz33mFSJxA,213060,215940,in the case of Green Tech the Europeans
5lz33mFSJxA,215940,217760,have stopped
5lz33mFSJxA,217760,220440,processing a lot of the non-ferrous
5lz33mFSJxA,220440,222900,materials that are required in order to
5lz33mFSJxA,222900,224040,build the stuff in the first place
5lz33mFSJxA,224040,225659,whether that is copper or lithium or
5lz33mFSJxA,225659,226440,whatever
5lz33mFSJxA,226440,228780,so what the Europeans are really asking
5lz33mFSJxA,228780,231799,for is for the Americans to subsidize
5lz33mFSJxA,231799,234299,European workers who will be using
5lz33mFSJxA,234299,236760,process materials that they import from
5lz33mFSJxA,236760,237659,China
5lz33mFSJxA,237659,240060,and let's just say that there is not a
5lz33mFSJxA,240060,242459,powerful American Lobby that wants to
5lz33mFSJxA,242459,245879,subsidize Europe and China at the same
5lz33mFSJxA,245879,247080,time
5lz33mFSJxA,247080,249060,so it's not going to happen Biden's
5lz33mFSJxA,249060,250319,going to get his way
5lz33mFSJxA,250319,254599,okay that's it for me until next time
