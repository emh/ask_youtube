w93XoP5g95o,0,"Hey everybody Peter zein here coming toyou from Colorado, uh the news of thisweek"
w93XoP5g95o,1,Is this oil export ban that theEuropeans are putting in place the ideais that Russia will still be able toexport their crew to Internationalmarkets? But there is now a price cap inwhat
w93XoP5g95o,2,They can ask
w93XoP5g95o,3,"It'S currently it'sset at 60, although they will change thatover time based on what happens"
w93XoP5g95o,4,"Whathappens with International Energy pricesthe enforcement mechanism is that theEuropeans dominate global insurance, andGlobal Maritime services and that anyvessel, that is carrying crude, that isabove, that sixty dollars, that was thesale Point, won't be able to access anyEuropean, Financial or physical servicesso"
w93XoP5g95o,5,"That'S Port access, that's insurancepolicies, and without a maritimeinsurance policy Your Vessel could notinterport exit port or leave aconstrained Waterway say like the SuezCanal or the Turkish Straitsnow"
w93XoP5g95o,6,"This is this is unprecedented in anynumber of ways, and so I really don'tknow how it's going to play out"
w93XoP5g95o,7,"So thepurpose of this video is less to giveyou a firm forecast, but to give you anidea of kind of the Matrix of factorsand what matters so that you can kind ofdraw your own conclusions and have someidea of what to look for the first andmost important thing"
w93XoP5g95o,8,"To keep in mind isthat, not all crude oil is made equalcrude oil is not fungible"
w93XoP5g95o,9,"You can't takecrude from a Texas field and put it intoRefinery that was designed for crudefrom a Saudi Arabian field and viceversa, and even within Russia we havemultiple crude grades"
w93XoP5g95o,10,The first one theone that matters the most is calledEuros crudeu-r-a-l-s uh
w93XoP5g95o,11,"It is basically everythingthat comes from the Northern or WesternSiberian projects, as well as a lot ofstuff that comes from Southern Russiait's, all put into the same network, andsent West, to export points via pipe thatgo through Ukraine or Belarus, to Europeor, to ports on the Black Sea or Thebaltic, Sea and collectively you'retalking here about about five, maybe fiveand a half million barrels a day, inevery given moment of which about halfof, which is exportednow"
w93XoP5g95o,12,"If, if, if this cap goes wrong and theRussians decide that they're not goingto produce at a price that they cannotinfluence much less control, then whatwould happen is pressure, would build upin the pipes all the way back up to thewellheads, and since this is inpermafrost, when the oil Stops flowing inpermafrost, it turns to gel, becomes aplug in the pipeline and the water thatcomes up as a byproduct freezes into iceand when water freezes it cracks thepipe from the inside, and it takes yearsif not decades to repair that sort ofsystem"
w93XoP5g95o,13,"The last time this happened, atscaleit was 1992and"
w93XoP5g95o,14,"In 1992 everything went offline, theytook the Russians 30 years to repair thedamage only most of the repair work wasnot done by the Russians"
w93XoP5g95o,15,"It was done, byoil services firms and they are nolonger operating in Russia for the mostpartnow"
w93XoP5g95o,16,Will this happen again? That is theopen question
w93XoP5g95o,17,"This is a prediction thatI made back in, I want to say April whenthe world was just going on it lookedlike we were going to get to seesignificant shut-ins and we did to thetune of about a million barrels, a daybut, not all of the inputs that go intoEuros Crude come from Western Siberia, inthe permafrost, there's about a millionmaybe, a million and a half barrels, a daythat come from more temperate locationslike todderstone and bashkuristan and sowhen"
w93XoP5g95o,18,The demand profile dropped off
w93XoP5g95o,19,Andthe Russians were left with thatpressure in the pipes and was buildingup to the wellheads
w93XoP5g95o,20,They chose to shutoff the wells and taters down inbashkarastan because they knew that theycould start those up later
w93XoP5g95o,21,They knewthey wouldn't have the freezing issueand that allowed the Russians to getaround itthis time around with the export ban
w93XoP5g95o,22,"Orthe fact that the insurance ban expandsin January, to be a lot more cohesiveit's, an open question of what willhappen first and what will happenfastest and we're going to see if theprice cap has an impact uh, the secondthing that's happened with Euros is thatthe Turks, who are one Of the world'slarger importers of Euro Crews havedecided to abide by the price cap andsince, they controlled the Turkishstreets, the Bosphorus and the Dardanelleso"
w93XoP5g95o,23,It allows about one and a halfmillion barrels a day of Earls to reachthe wider world
w93XoP5g95o,24,"That'S a really big dealnow! The Turks are doing this notnecessarily because they've taken a hardline in all things: Ukraine, war, but theysee - an excellent opportunity"
w93XoP5g95o,25,Herethey'Re one of the few countries thathas any sort ofposition in the Russian system
w93XoP5g95o,26,"Therussians will still talk to the Turksand, so they're, making the most of itthey import about 300 350000 barrels a day and if they can get apermanent discount on all of thatthey're, like sweet and they're perfectlywilling to cooperate uh the other chunksof Euros crew that are seaborne go Outfrom, the Baltic Sea and that's where Iwould expect a security issue to be abigger concern because you're thenSailing by a number of countries, thatare pathologically hostile to All ThingsRussian Estonia, Lafayette, LithuaniaSweden, Finland, Norway, Denmark, Poland, Ican easily see some of them kind, ofsticking their Coast Guard out"
w93XoP5g95o,27,"There andgrabbing a ship or two to inspect tomake sure that they're following therulesand, if they find out that they're notthen all of a sudden, the insurance, comesinto question and ships won't want to goin to uh the port of primorsk on theRussian Coast"
w93XoP5g95o,28,"Where the discouragementpart point is, and that's how we wouldget roughly another million and a halfthat, it would be back up now that byitself is the absolute maximum thatcould be disrupted without actuallyhurting the broad scale of what goes onin Siberia"
w93XoP5g95o,29,It would need more than thisbut
w93XoP5g95o,30,I think that's where we're mostlikely to see the disruption in terms ofsecurity concerns
w93XoP5g95o,31,"Okay, that's all urlsthere's one"
w93XoP5g95o,32,"Other crude blend that theRussians have it's called espo theEastern, Siberian, Pacific pipelineand"
w93XoP5g95o,33,"It takes crude from Eastern Siberiaand sends it through a very, very longpipe route to get to nakodka, which istheir port near Vladivostok, on the eastcoast of the Eurasian land mass going tothe Pacific Ocean"
w93XoP5g95o,34,"Now, most of this crudegoes to Japan, Korea, China and India, muchcloser physically to the Eastern marketsthan, the Euros discouragement points arealso, because the Europeans are notinvolved on that side of the continentwe, don't see the same"
w93XoP5g95o,35,"Split in pricingso Euros is already selling at somewherebetween, 20 and 35 dollars a discount andso, it's very close to the 60 price capthat"
w93XoP5g95o,36,The new regulations require onceyou get to the East Coast
w93XoP5g95o,37,It'S more
w93XoP5g95o,38,A noone wants to feed a little dirty and sothe price discount is only between fiveand fifteen dollars
w93XoP5g95o,39,This is where we'regoing to find outwhether or not
w93XoP5g95o,40,"The insurance policyshift and the price cap shift actuallyhas a real, long-term impactbecause"
w93XoP5g95o,41,"These are areas that, if thereever was a national interest in buildinga domestic Insurance system to getaround what the Europeans are doing, thisis"
w93XoP5g95o,42,"Where would you try it because theEuropeans are on the other side of thecontinent? There'S been a lot ofresentment that the Europeans havecontrolled this financial space? For solong anyway, and I can see the Chinese inparticular having a reason to try tooffer their own insurance policies, inorder to just get away from that systemof the price Gap altogether"
w93XoP5g95o,43,Here'S theproblemthe Chinese are terrified of secondaryeffects
w93XoP5g95o,44,They realize they have nofriends left in Washington
w93XoP5g95o,45,They realizethey have very few friends left inBrussels
w93XoP5g95o,46,"They realize that theireconomic system is in trouble and theyrealize that their own demography is soatrocious, that they are incapable ofmaking any sort of transition to aconsumption-led system"
w93XoP5g95o,47,"So they like theidea of the Russians, not being destroyedin this war and they really like theidea of not having to lash themselves tothe Russians and offering a NationalInsurance indemnification system for thesole purpose of getting around aEuropean sanctions regime that is likelyto be perceived in Europe as arelatively"
w93XoP5g95o,48,"Hostile Act and they don'tknow what the Europeans will do, nextmuch less"
w93XoP5g95o,49,"If the Americans get involvedso, I actually see this being instead ofa broad scale system that the Chinesepunch into each individual countryhaving to make the decision for theirown oil imports where they want to do itfor themselves"
w93XoP5g95o,50,"So Chinese insurance forChinese shipments, Indian insurance, forIndian shipments, it kind of diffuses theanger that might boil up out of theEuropean capitalsand makes it less likely"
w93XoP5g95o,51,"It will be aharsh response now that might not begreat for the price cap, but it alsomeans"
w93XoP5g95o,52,"The Chinese are going out of theirway to abide at least in part by thesanctions regime moving forwardnow, that's a lot of minutia"
w93XoP5g95o,53,If you'relooking for a single big takeaway hereit is we've had more or less a singleGlobal price for oil
w93XoP5g95o,54,Since 1945
w93XoP5g95o,55,", theAmericans have provided Freedom of theSeas and we've had a single currencymodel in order to undergrade all thefinancial sides of thingsthat's going away"
w93XoP5g95o,56,"We now have twodifferent price points just for Russiancrude without a security incident on thehigh seats, which is almost certainlycoming in the Baltic Sea, and we now havemultiple countries that are gettinginvolved, establishing sequestered linesof Supply from specific countries"
w93XoP5g95o,57,"Tospecific countriesyou break things up like that and thereis no longer an interest for any of thecountries that have a large Navy forkeeping Global shipments, safe for thisstuff on a global scale"
w93XoP5g95o,58,They will beincreasingly curious and interested inonly
w93XoP5g95o,59,The cargos go from places ofinterest to themselves and in that sortof environmentthe temptation to mess with someoneelse's supply lines are incredibly Highwe are very rapidly in energy termsgetting back to the world of the 1930sand
w93XoP5g95o,60,"For those of you who know your 1930sstrategy and economic patterns, I thinkyou can identify exactly where thatleadsfun okay, that's it from me until nexttime"
