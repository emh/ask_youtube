w93XoP5g95o,0,"Hey everybody Peter zein, here coming to you from Colorado uh the news of this week"
w93XoP5g95o,1,"Is this oil export ban that the Europeans are putting in place? The idea is that Russia will still be able to export their crew to International markets, but there is now a price cap in what they can ask it's"
w93XoP5g95o,2,"Currently it's set at 60, although they will change that over time"
w93XoP5g95o,3,"Based on what happens, what happens with International Energy prices? The enforcement mechanism is that the Europeans dominate global insurance and Global Maritime services and that any vessel that is carrying crude"
w93XoP5g95o,4,"That is above that sixty dollars, that was the sale Point, won't be able to access any European Financial or physical services"
w93XoP5g95o,5,"So that's Port access, that's insurance policies and without a maritime insurance policy Your Vessel could not interport exit port or leave a constrained Waterway say like the Suez Canal or the Turkish Straits"
w93XoP5g95o,6,"Now this is this is unprecedented in any number of ways, and so I really don't know how it's going to play out"
w93XoP5g95o,7,"So the purpose of this video is less to give you a firm forecast, but to give you an idea of kind of the Matrix of factors and what matters so that you can kind of draw your own conclusions and have some idea of what to look for The first and most important thing to keep in mind is that not all crude oil is made equal crude oil is not fungible"
w93XoP5g95o,8,"You can't take crude from a Texas field and put it into Refinery that was designed for crude from a Saudi Arabian field and vice versa, and even within Russia we have multiple crude grades, the first one, the one that matters the most is called Euros: crude u-r-a-l-s Uh, it is basically everything that comes from the Northern or Western Siberian projects, as well as a lot of stuff that comes from Southern Russia"
w93XoP5g95o,9,"It'S all put into the same network and sent West to export points via pipe that go through Ukraine or Belarus to Europe or to ports on the Black Sea or the Baltic Sea and collectively you're talking here about about five, maybe five and a half million barrels"
w93XoP5g95o,10,"A day in every given moment of which about half of which is exported now, if, if, if this cap goes wrong and the Russians decide that they're not going to produce at a price that they cannot influence much less control, then what would happen is pressure would Build up in the pipes all the way back up to the wellheads, and since this is in permafrost, when the oil stops flowing in permafrost, it turns to gel, becomes a plug in the pipeline and the water that comes up as a byproduct freezes into ice"
w93XoP5g95o,11,"And when water freezes it cracks the pipe from the inside and it takes years, if not decades, to repair that sort of system"
w93XoP5g95o,12,"The last time this happened at scale, it was 1992 and in 1992 everything went offline"
w93XoP5g95o,13,They took the Russians 30 years to repair the damage
w93XoP5g95o,14,Only most of the repair work was not done by the Russians
w93XoP5g95o,15,It was done by oil services firms and they are no longer operating in Russia for the most part
w93XoP5g95o,16,Now will this happen again? That is the open question
w93XoP5g95o,17,This is a prediction that I made back in
w93XoP5g95o,18,"I want to say April when the world was just going on, it looked like we were going to get to see significant shut-ins and we did to the tune of about a million barrels"
w93XoP5g95o,19,"A day, but not all of the inputs that go into Euros crude, come from Western Siberia in the permafrost, there's about a million, maybe a million and a half barrels a day that come from more temperate locations like todderstone and bashkuristan, and so when the demand profile Dropped off and the Russians were left with that pressure in the pipes and was building up to the wellheads"
w93XoP5g95o,20,They chose to shut off the wells and taters down in bashkarastan because they knew that they could start those up later
w93XoP5g95o,21,They knew they wouldn't have the freezing issue and that allowed the Russians to get around it
w93XoP5g95o,22,This time around with the export ban or the fact that the insurance ban expands in January to be a lot more cohesive
w93XoP5g95o,23,It'S an open question of what will happen first and what will happen fastest and we're going to see if the price cap has an impact uh
w93XoP5g95o,24,The second thing: that's happened with Euros
w93XoP5g95o,25,"Is that the Turks who are one of the world's larger importers of Euro Crews have decided to abide by the price cap? And since they controlled the Turkish streets, the Bosphorus and the Dardanelle? So it allows about one and a half million barrels a day of Earls to reach the wider world"
w93XoP5g95o,26,That'S a really big deal now
w93XoP5g95o,27,"The Turks are doing this, not necessarily because they've taken a hard line in all things: Ukraine war, but they see an excellent opportunity here, they're one of the few countries that has any sort of position in the Russian system"
w93XoP5g95o,28,The Russians will still talk to the Turks and so they're making the most of it
w93XoP5g95o,29,"They import about 300, 350 000 barrels a day and if they can get a permanent discount on all of that, they're like sweet and they're perfectly willing to cooperate"
w93XoP5g95o,30,"Uh, the other chunks of Euros, crew that are seaborne go out from the Baltic Sea, and that's where I would expect a security issue to be a bigger concern, because you're then Sailing by a number of countries that are pathologically hostile to All Things"
w93XoP5g95o,31,"Russian Estonia, Lafayette, Lithuania, Sweden, Finland, Norway, Denmark, Poland"
w93XoP5g95o,32,"I can easily see some of them kind of sticking their Coast Guard out there and grabbing a ship or two to inspect, to make sure that they're following the rules and if they find out that they're"
w93XoP5g95o,33,"Not then, all of a sudden, the insurance comes into question and ships won't want to go in to uh the port of primorsk on the Russian Coast, where the discouragement part point is, and that's how we would get roughly another million and a half that it would Be back up now that by itself is the absolute maximum that could be disrupted without actually hurting the broad scale of what goes on in Siberia"
w93XoP5g95o,34,"It would need more than this, but I think that's where we're most likely to see the disruption in terms of security concerns"
w93XoP5g95o,35,"Okay, that's all urls! There'S one other crude blend that the Russians have"
w93XoP5g95o,36,"It'S called espo the Eastern Siberian Pacific pipeline and it takes crude from Eastern Siberia and sends it through a very, very long pipe route to get to nakodka, which is their port near Vladivostok, on the east coast of the Eurasian land mass going to the Pacific Ocean"
w93XoP5g95o,37,"Now most of this crude goes to Japan, Korea, China and India, much closer physically to the Eastern markets than the Euros discouragement points are also because the Europeans are not involved on that side of the continent"
w93XoP5g95o,38,"We don't see the same split in pricing, so Euros is already selling at somewhere between 20 and 35 dollars a discount, and so it's very close to the 60 price cap that the new regulations require"
w93XoP5g95o,39,"Once you get to the East Coast, it's more a no one wants to feed a little dirty, and so the price discount is only between five and fifteen dollars"
w93XoP5g95o,40,"This is where we're going to find out whether or not the insurance policy shift and the price cap shift actually has a real long-term impact, because these are areas that, if there ever was a national interest in building a domestic Insurance system to get around what the Europeans are doing this is where would you try it because the Europeans are on the other side of the continent? There'S been a lot of resentment that the Europeans have controlled this financial space for so long anyway, and I can see the Chinese in particular having a reason to try to offer their own insurance policies in order to just get away from that system of the price Gap altogether, here's the problem - the Chinese - are terrified of secondary effects"
w93XoP5g95o,41,They realize they have no friends left in Washington
w93XoP5g95o,42,They realize they have very few friends left in Brussels
w93XoP5g95o,43,They realize that their economic system is in trouble and they realize that their own demography is so atrocious that they are incapable of making any sort of transition to a consumption-led system
w93XoP5g95o,44,"So they like the idea of the Russians not being destroyed in this war, and they really like the idea of not having to lash themselves to the Russians and offering a National Insurance indemnification system for the sole purpose of getting around a European sanctions regime"
w93XoP5g95o,45,"That is likely to be perceived in Europe as a relatively hostile Act, and they don't know what the Europeans will do next, much less if the Americans get involved"
w93XoP5g95o,46,So I actually see this being instead of a broad scale system that the Chinese punch into each individual country having to make the decision for their own oil imports where they want to do it for themselves
w93XoP5g95o,47,"So Chinese insurance for Chinese shipments, Indian insurance for Indian shipments"
w93XoP5g95o,48,It kind of diffuses the anger that might boil up out of the European capitals and makes it less likely
w93XoP5g95o,49,"It will be a harsh response now that might not be great for the price cap, but it also means the Chinese are going out of their way to abide, at least in part by the sanctions regime moving forward"
w93XoP5g95o,50,"Now that's a lot of minutia if you're looking for a single big takeaway here it is, we've had more or less a single Global price for oil"
w93XoP5g95o,51,Since 1945
w93XoP5g95o,52,", the Americans have provided Freedom of the Seas and we've had a single currency model in order to undergrade all the financial sides of things that's going away"
w93XoP5g95o,53,"We now have two different price points: just for Russian crude without a security incident on the high seats, which is almost certainly coming in the Baltic Sea, and we now have multiple countries that are getting involved, establishing sequestered lines of Supply from specific countries to specific countries"
w93XoP5g95o,54,"You break things up like that, and there is no longer an interest for any of the countries that have a large Navy for keeping Global shipments safe for this stuff on a global scale"
w93XoP5g95o,55,They will be increasingly curious and interested in only the cargos go from places of interest to themselves and in that sort of environment the temptation to mess with someone else's supply lines are incredibly High
w93XoP5g95o,56,"We are very rapidly in energy terms, getting back to the world of the 1930s and for those of you who know your 1930s strategy and economic patterns, I think you can identify exactly where that leads fun"
w93XoP5g95o,57,"Okay, that's it from me until next time,"
