bK397YwduhQ,0,1920,hey everybody Peter zein here coming to
bK397YwduhQ,1920,4200,you from Colorado uh today I wanted to
bK397YwduhQ,4200,6240,look at the financial situation from a
bK397YwduhQ,6240,7740,slightly different anger angle and
bK397YwduhQ,7740,9900,that's one of Workforce so one of the
bK397YwduhQ,9900,11880,things that happens when capital is
bK397YwduhQ,11880,13740,really cheap for a really long time and
bK397YwduhQ,13740,15839,everyone can borrow at ridiculous rates
bK397YwduhQ,15839,18180,and the stock market is booming is you
bK397YwduhQ,18180,20760,get a lot of money that is chasing
bK397YwduhQ,20760,23640,projects that were probably let's just
bK397YwduhQ,23640,25880,call them risky not necessarily stupid
bK397YwduhQ,25880,29460,but there was an investment idea behind
bK397YwduhQ,29460,32880,them and it probably was okay but it
bK397YwduhQ,32880,34559,required either really really high
bK397YwduhQ,34559,36420,payouts or really really cheap money to
bK397YwduhQ,36420,38700,give it a try and that is something we
bK397YwduhQ,38700,40620,have seen throughout the tech space uh
bK397YwduhQ,40620,42480,Silicon Valley and all that now of going
bK397YwduhQ,42480,45239,back for 15 20 years and it's been a
bK397YwduhQ,45239,46620,kind of a great environment because
bK397YwduhQ,46620,48780,you've had really cheap Capital you've
bK397YwduhQ,48780,50160,had the Millennials coming of age and
bK397YwduhQ,50160,51660,being in their 20s and then their 30s
bK397YwduhQ,51660,53879,providing an ample Workforce that is
bK397YwduhQ,53879,56340,tech savvy you marry those two things
bK397YwduhQ,56340,58440,together and you can take a little bit
bK397YwduhQ,58440,61739,of a longer range with your investment
bK397YwduhQ,61739,63600,strategy because you don't have to get
bK397YwduhQ,63600,65640,the payout right away because the costs
bK397YwduhQ,65640,67680,for taking the long term are low because
bK397YwduhQ,67680,69180,the cost of the money to make it run in
bK397YwduhQ,69180,71700,the short and the midterm are low
bK397YwduhQ,71700,74220,and that allows companies like meta or
bK397YwduhQ,74220,77220,Amazon or Google to just Hoover up huge
bK397YwduhQ,77220,78720,amounts of the workforce because they
bK397YwduhQ,78720,80880,can afford to do so and the stock market
bK397YwduhQ,80880,82979,plays a role because people see these as
bK397YwduhQ,82979,87299,long range world changing Technologies
bK397YwduhQ,87299,89340,implementing new things and greater
bK397YwduhQ,89340,90840,efficiencies and basically making life
bK397YwduhQ,90840,92040,better for everyone and they're willing
bK397YwduhQ,92040,93479,to put their money behind that stock
bK397YwduhQ,93479,95340,markets go to the roof
bK397YwduhQ,95340,98220,it also works in Reverse when the money
bK397YwduhQ,98220,101759,starts to become more expensive then
bK397YwduhQ,101759,104100,nothing that worked before Works any
bK397YwduhQ,104100,105960,longer all of a sudden the long term
bK397YwduhQ,105960,108180,looks a little risky and the short and
bK397YwduhQ,108180,110100,the midterm gets a lot more expensive
bK397YwduhQ,110100,112200,and so we are seeing all of the tech
bK397YwduhQ,112200,115380,companies now shedding jobs that they've
bK397YwduhQ,115380,118500,spent 15 years building up in some cases
bK397YwduhQ,118500,120079,we're looking at these big companies
bK397YwduhQ,120079,123119,removing over 20 maybe even 30 percent
bK397YwduhQ,123119,124860,of their Workforce in just a matter of
bK397YwduhQ,124860,126060,weeks
bK397YwduhQ,126060,129360,now this is good and this is bad The Bad
bK397YwduhQ,129360,132180,is the bad is pretty straightforward uh
bK397YwduhQ,132180,134099,the value preposition for Silicon Valley
bK397YwduhQ,134099,135540,just isn't there compared to what it was
bK397YwduhQ,135540,137520,recently and for companies that have
bK397YwduhQ,137520,139200,been trading as tech companies on
bK397YwduhQ,139200,141060,betting on being transformational but
bK397YwduhQ,141060,144120,get their income from not Tech methods
bK397YwduhQ,144120,147180,the problem is very very substantial so
bK397YwduhQ,147180,149340,when I think of companies like Tesla
bK397YwduhQ,149340,151200,that have been imagined as tech
bK397YwduhQ,151200,153000,companies financed as tech companies
bK397YwduhQ,153000,155340,invested in as tech companies but their
bK397YwduhQ,155340,156840,income follows a more traditional
bK397YwduhQ,156840,159500,manufacturing model
bK397YwduhQ,159500,161879,especially since Tesla has now gobbled
bK397YwduhQ,161879,163560,up all of the subsidies that were on
bK397YwduhQ,163560,166800,available for early EV adoption we are
bK397YwduhQ,166800,168900,probably going to see some catastrophic
bK397YwduhQ,168900,171000,losses not just in terms of jobs but the
bK397YwduhQ,171000,172620,stock market value of the company as
bK397YwduhQ,172620,174480,well and the market really hasn't
bK397YwduhQ,174480,177720,digested that yet let's focus on some of
bK397YwduhQ,177720,179640,the good though Google and Amazon and
bK397YwduhQ,179640,181140,the like have been hoovering up American
bK397YwduhQ,181140,184080,labor now for years over a decade and
bK397YwduhQ,184080,186000,that's made it very difficult for small
bK397YwduhQ,186000,188040,and medium companies who generally have
bK397YwduhQ,188040,189840,a little bit more of a problem accessing
bK397YwduhQ,189840,192540,Capital markets to get qualified labor
bK397YwduhQ,192540,194360,to help with any Tech related projects
bK397YwduhQ,194360,197819,well by my math Silicon Valley has laid
bK397YwduhQ,197819,199739,off over a hundred thousand people in
bK397YwduhQ,199739,202019,just the last two months these are
bK397YwduhQ,202019,203700,people with programming experience and
bK397YwduhQ,203700,205019,software experience and
bK397YwduhQ,205019,207540,operationalization experience who for
bK397YwduhQ,207540,208860,the first time in their professional
bK397YwduhQ,208860,210300,careers or discovering they actually
bK397YwduhQ,210300,212879,have to go out and sell themselves to a
bK397YwduhQ,212879,214739,potential employer
bK397YwduhQ,214739,217680,in perhaps a bit of a market downturn
bK397YwduhQ,217680,221040,well if you are any company that has not
bK397YwduhQ,221040,223019,had like kind of the tuck Mantra going
bK397YwduhQ,223019,226200,on all of a sudden there is a labor
bK397YwduhQ,226200,228060,force out there that is available
bK397YwduhQ,228060,230819,so are we heading into a downturn of Sam
bK397YwduhQ,230819,232500,flavor that doesn't seem like to be very
bK397YwduhQ,232500,234480,controversial anymore will it be a
bK397YwduhQ,234480,236700,full-on recession can't rule it out and
bK397YwduhQ,236700,238080,I understand why a lot of people think
bK397YwduhQ,238080,240900,that it might already be here but that
bK397YwduhQ,240900,243540,doesn't mean that everyone Falls at once
bK397YwduhQ,243540,245640,just because Capital has become more
bK397YwduhQ,245640,247620,expensive doesn't mean it's become more
bK397YwduhQ,247620,251280,expensive for everyone equally and the
bK397YwduhQ,251280,253620,small business administration is a group
bK397YwduhQ,253620,255000,within the American federal government
bK397YwduhQ,255000,257459,who provides below Market Capital costs
bK397YwduhQ,257459,259979,for smaller companies which means we
bK397YwduhQ,259979,262380,might actually be seeing an explosion of
bK397YwduhQ,262380,264960,economic activity hiring-based economic
bK397YwduhQ,264960,267180,activity for smaller companies who are
bK397YwduhQ,267180,270300,now looking to implement 10 to 15 years
bK397YwduhQ,270300,272699,of technological advancement more or
bK397YwduhQ,272699,274740,less on the cheap in a very short period
bK397YwduhQ,274740,277500,of time and for the first time in recent
bK397YwduhQ,277500,280440,history the labor is actually there to
bK397YwduhQ,280440,281400,do it
bK397YwduhQ,281400,286340,okay that's it for me until next time
