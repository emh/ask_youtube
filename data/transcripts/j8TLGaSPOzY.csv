j8TLGaSPOzY,0,1860,hey everyone here Peter zein coming to
j8TLGaSPOzY,1860,3840,you from Colorado with part four of our
j8TLGaSPOzY,3840,6480,Ukraine implications Series today we're
j8TLGaSPOzY,6480,7740,going to be talking about what this
j8TLGaSPOzY,7740,10620,means for American operational strategy
j8TLGaSPOzY,10620,12120,as opposed to kind of our grand
j8TLGaSPOzY,12120,13740,geopolitics
j8TLGaSPOzY,13740,16139,what we're seeing in Ukraine is a
j8TLGaSPOzY,16139,17820,potential model for how the United
j8TLGaSPOzY,17820,20640,States will fight Wars for the next
j8TLGaSPOzY,20640,23279,decade or two one of the many many many
j8TLGaSPOzY,23279,24199,many
j8TLGaSPOzY,24199,26580,consequences of the 20 years of the
j8TLGaSPOzY,26580,28019,global war on terror is that the
j8TLGaSPOzY,28019,29340,Americans for the moment are pretty much
j8TLGaSPOzY,29340,31679,done we're not going to be deploying
j8TLGaSPOzY,31679,34440,troops in number anywhere in the world
j8TLGaSPOzY,34440,37260,as a tripwire or as a major Force
j8TLGaSPOzY,37260,39480,designed to overthrow a government and
j8TLGaSPOzY,39480,41520,remake it into whatever image we see fit
j8TLGaSPOzY,41520,44879,it's bloody the first part knocking off
j8TLGaSPOzY,44879,46260,the government that's the easy part and
j8TLGaSPOzY,46260,47460,then dealing what happens with the next
j8TLGaSPOzY,47460,48660,day the next month the next year the
j8TLGaSPOzY,48660,50760,next decade that sucks and as we have
j8TLGaSPOzY,50760,53039,discovered with over a hundred thousand
j8TLGaSPOzY,53039,55199,troops and trillions of dollars of
j8TLGaSPOzY,55199,57480,investment in Afghanistan and Iraq
j8TLGaSPOzY,57480,61020,we are left with a broken nation and a
j8TLGaSPOzY,61020,63359,nation that is I don't want to call
j8TLGaSPOzY,63359,65640,pathologically hostile but not very fond
j8TLGaSPOzY,65640,68040,about the United States about anything
j8TLGaSPOzY,68040,71159,uh it didn't work uh and so the United
j8TLGaSPOzY,71159,73619,States needs a different method and in
j8TLGaSPOzY,73619,76799,that method the Army is no longer an
j8TLGaSPOzY,76799,79020,option in terms of ground deployment we
j8TLGaSPOzY,79020,81000,will use the Army if we are faced with a
j8TLGaSPOzY,81000,84540,strategic threat but regardless of what
j8TLGaSPOzY,84540,86520,you say about how we did Iraq and
j8TLGaSPOzY,86520,88259,Afghanistan I don't think any of us
j8TLGaSPOzY,88259,90180,really thought of the two countries
j8TLGaSPOzY,90180,92100,themselves as strategic threats there
j8TLGaSPOzY,92100,93299,may have been elements within them like
j8TLGaSPOzY,93299,95280,Al Qaeda that required getting knocked
j8TLGaSPOzY,95280,97140,off but to say that that required a
j8TLGaSPOzY,97140,98460,hundred thousand troops no no the
j8TLGaSPOzY,98460,99960,hundred thousand troops went to try to
j8TLGaSPOzY,99960,102900,reshape the local space so that a future
j8TLGaSPOzY,102900,104939,strategic threat would not arise and in
j8TLGaSPOzY,104939,107759,that the war on terror was a failure so
j8TLGaSPOzY,107759,110939,Ukraine here we have a highly motivated
j8TLGaSPOzY,110939,112860,country of about 40 million people who
j8TLGaSPOzY,112860,116100,is standing up to a nearly as motivated
j8TLGaSPOzY,116100,118860,country of roughly 135-145 million
j8TLGaSPOzY,118860,121860,Russian members who knows and all they
j8TLGaSPOzY,121860,125100,require is every bullet and drop of fuel
j8TLGaSPOzY,125100,127140,that they need to prosecute a war
j8TLGaSPOzY,127140,128700,so what we're seeing is the United
j8TLGaSPOzY,128700,131280,States has identified a strategic threat
j8TLGaSPOzY,131280,134640,Russia and is using a local power to
j8TLGaSPOzY,134640,137360,fight the war with American Technical
j8TLGaSPOzY,137360,140819,and Industrial infrastructure so we
j8TLGaSPOzY,140819,143280,provide the equipment but it's more than
j8TLGaSPOzY,143280,145620,that the technical side of things the
j8TLGaSPOzY,145620,147540,United States has the most sophisticated
j8TLGaSPOzY,147540,149459,satellite monitoring system in the world
j8TLGaSPOzY,149459,150720,I'd argue it's better than everyone
j8TLGaSPOzY,150720,153420,else's combined by a significant margin
j8TLGaSPOzY,153420,155459,probably a factor of four or five
j8TLGaSPOzY,155459,156959,and we are providing Time On Target
j8TLGaSPOzY,156959,159599,information for the ukrainians to launch
j8TLGaSPOzY,159599,161700,artillery and Rocket strikes on targets
j8TLGaSPOzY,161700,163560,that are Miles tens of miles away and
j8TLGaSPOzY,163560,165180,those rockets and artillery shells are
j8TLGaSPOzY,165180,167340,hitting within a few feet of where
j8TLGaSPOzY,167340,169319,they're aimed at you you can't do that
j8TLGaSPOzY,169319,171660,with just the normal equipment even if
j8TLGaSPOzY,171660,173340,we didn't have kill switches in all of
j8TLGaSPOzY,173340,175800,our gear and for the most part we do
j8TLGaSPOzY,175800,178319,without actively tapping the American
j8TLGaSPOzY,178319,181800,satellite and Information Network
j8TLGaSPOzY,181800,183599,even if the ukrainians could fire these
j8TLGaSPOzY,183599,184560,things on their own they wouldn't be
j8TLGaSPOzY,184560,185700,able to hit the targets that they're
j8TLGaSPOzY,185700,186660,hitting they wouldn't be able to
j8TLGaSPOzY,186660,189420,identify them that requires a degree of
j8TLGaSPOzY,189420,191819,American involvement but not a degree of
j8TLGaSPOzY,191819,194879,American involvement in Ukraine
j8TLGaSPOzY,194879,197700,so there's a whole kill chain here once
j8TLGaSPOzY,197700,199319,you identify the target you have to get
j8TLGaSPOzY,199319,201180,that information to a weapon system that
j8TLGaSPOzY,201180,202739,is in range along with the coordinates
j8TLGaSPOzY,202739,204120,and the guidance information so that
j8TLGaSPOzY,204120,205440,weapon systems can actually Hit the
j8TLGaSPOzY,205440,208680,Target in the past that kill chain has
j8TLGaSPOzY,208680,210540,been measured in hours
j8TLGaSPOzY,210540,212099,one of the many many things that we've
j8TLGaSPOzY,212099,214140,seen as a result of improved information
j8TLGaSPOzY,214140,215940,technology in just the last three or
j8TLGaSPOzY,215940,217620,four years is reducing that kill change
j8TLGaSPOzY,217620,220080,in just a few minutes and this when
j8TLGaSPOzY,220080,222180,American operators are not the ones who
j8TLGaSPOzY,222180,224280,are using the equipment within the end
j8TLGaSPOzY,224280,226940,country this is the model for the future
j8TLGaSPOzY,226940,229440,taking weapon systems that for the most
j8TLGaSPOzY,229440,230760,part the United States considers
j8TLGaSPOzY,230760,232620,relatively low Tech and relatively
j8TLGaSPOzY,232620,235019,outdated transferring them to a third
j8TLGaSPOzY,235019,236700,country that is fighting a war that we
j8TLGaSPOzY,236700,238379,find to be in our strategic interests
j8TLGaSPOzY,238379,240239,now I'm sure people are going to hear
j8TLGaSPOzY,240239,241920,that statement like oh of course the
j8TLGaSPOzY,241920,243959,Americans baited the Russians no no I'm
j8TLGaSPOzY,243959,245700,sorry
j8TLGaSPOzY,245700,248400,the Russians required no baiting to
j8TLGaSPOzY,248400,251599,launch an imperialistic fascist
j8TLGaSPOzY,251599,255120,genocidal War they did that all on their
j8TLGaSPOzY,255120,257820,own uh this I would underline is one of
j8TLGaSPOzY,257820,258959,the reasons one of the many many many
j8TLGaSPOzY,258959,260519,reasons why the United States and the
j8TLGaSPOzY,260519,263400,Russians have not seen eye to eye since
j8TLGaSPOzY,263400,267180,World War II uh because their method of
j8TLGaSPOzY,267180,268740,fighting a war is just something we find
j8TLGaSPOzY,268740,270720,uh morally repugnant and at least a
j8TLGaSPOzY,270720,273360,strategically distasteful anyway back to
j8TLGaSPOzY,273360,275280,the more important topic
j8TLGaSPOzY,275280,278040,this sort of conflict is something that
j8TLGaSPOzY,278040,280380,can be leveraged at scale at any given
j8TLGaSPOzY,280380,282120,moment there are dozens of operatives
j8TLGaSPOzY,282120,283740,within the Ukrainian system that are
j8TLGaSPOzY,283740,284880,interfacing with the American
j8TLGaSPOzY,284880,286800,equivalents back in the United States or
j8TLGaSPOzY,286800,288780,in NATO countries providing this
j8TLGaSPOzY,288780,290580,real-time information and providing
j8TLGaSPOzY,290580,293400,roughly 80 to 90 percent of the
j8TLGaSPOzY,293400,296100,technical steps of the entire kill chain
j8TLGaSPOzY,296100,299100,doing it this way make sure that the war
j8TLGaSPOzY,299100,301020,gets steered in directions that you
j8TLGaSPOzY,301020,302820,think are productive and not ones that
j8TLGaSPOzY,302820,305220,are damaging to your interests this
j8TLGaSPOzY,305220,307620,isn't World War II when we were
j8TLGaSPOzY,307620,309780,providing the Soviets with artillery and
j8TLGaSPOzY,309780,312060,shells and fuel because they would use
j8TLGaSPOzY,312060,314220,them however they felt was appropriate
j8TLGaSPOzY,314220,316440,in this case if there's a specific
j8TLGaSPOzY,316440,319320,tactical Target that we don't want the
j8TLGaSPOzY,319320,321000,ukrainians to hit no number one we
j8TLGaSPOzY,321000,322320,wouldn't tell them about it number two
j8TLGaSPOzY,322320,323699,we wouldn't provide the Strategic
j8TLGaSPOzY,323699,325380,guidance excuse me the tactical
j8TLGaSPOzY,325380,327419,information that is required for them to
j8TLGaSPOzY,327419,328680,Target those things
j8TLGaSPOzY,328680,332460,so one of the very very few scenarios
j8TLGaSPOzY,332460,333840,that I can see where nuclear weapons
j8TLGaSPOzY,333840,335460,could come into play in the Ukraine war
j8TLGaSPOzY,335460,338340,would be if the ukrainians decide to
j8TLGaSPOzY,338340,340500,cross the border into Russia proper that
j8TLGaSPOzY,340500,341880,they've just experienced such runaway
j8TLGaSPOzY,341880,343500,success they decided to go for the gold
j8TLGaSPOzY,343500,346020,well they can't do that without American
j8TLGaSPOzY,346020,347940,Gear and the American Gear cannot be
j8TLGaSPOzY,347940,349440,used in the way that it's being used in
j8TLGaSPOzY,349440,351660,Ukraine right now without active
j8TLGaSPOzY,351660,354180,American participation so we do not need
j8TLGaSPOzY,354180,356400,to worry about the ukrainians
j8TLGaSPOzY,356400,358699,getting ahead of themselves
j8TLGaSPOzY,358699,361199,unless we decide we want to empower them
j8TLGaSPOzY,361199,363000,to do so and I can't imagine that is
j8TLGaSPOzY,363000,364380,going to happen
j8TLGaSPOzY,364380,367680,you can apply this model to any place
j8TLGaSPOzY,367680,371160,where you've got a numerically Superior
j8TLGaSPOzY,371160,374160,foe who has some logistical concerns I
j8TLGaSPOzY,374160,376199,can see this working great in Korea or
j8TLGaSPOzY,376199,380160,Taiwan I can see this working with Egypt
j8TLGaSPOzY,380160,382940,any place where there are foes nearby
j8TLGaSPOzY,382940,386460,that can't be handled unless you can
j8TLGaSPOzY,386460,388139,provide mid to long range strike
j8TLGaSPOzY,388139,390720,capability with precision and if you can
j8TLGaSPOzY,390720,393539,do that the math changes
j8TLGaSPOzY,393539,395160,the other side of the equation that
j8TLGaSPOzY,395160,396600,we're not seeing in Ukraine but we will
j8TLGaSPOzY,396600,398639,see else Blair Are Special Operations
j8TLGaSPOzY,398639,401160,forces now Navy Seals Army Rangers CIA
j8TLGaSPOzY,401160,403800,that sort of thing where you take a few
j8TLGaSPOzY,403800,405900,small teams usually numbering fewer than
j8TLGaSPOzY,405900,408479,100 people and throw them Behind Enemy
j8TLGaSPOzY,408479,410120,Lines or you have them directly
j8TLGaSPOzY,410120,413460,interfacing with allies in order to get
j8TLGaSPOzY,413460,414960,more bang for the buck
j8TLGaSPOzY,414960,417840,now in the global war and Terror our
j8TLGaSPOzY,417840,420240,Special Operation Forces operated with
j8TLGaSPOzY,420240,422100,local groups like the Kurds or the
j8TLGaSPOzY,422100,425580,Hazara uh in Afghanistan in order to
j8TLGaSPOzY,425580,427919,kind of bring in American airstrikes
j8TLGaSPOzY,427919,429419,basically you travel with a team for
j8TLGaSPOzY,429419,431220,protection and for getting the local lay
j8TLGaSPOzY,431220,433139,of the land identifying targets and then
j8TLGaSPOzY,433139,435120,you called on airstrikes that'll still
j8TLGaSPOzY,435120,436979,continue but one of the things we're
j8TLGaSPOzY,436979,438840,seeing with uh the better artillery and
j8TLGaSPOzY,438840,440880,Rocket coordination is this going to
j8TLGaSPOzY,440880,442860,happen to multiple levels the the reason
j8TLGaSPOzY,442860,444479,that the Special Operation Forces are
j8TLGaSPOzY,444479,446160,not active in Ukraine is because Ukraine
j8TLGaSPOzY,446160,447720,has nukes and if you put American boots
j8TLGaSPOzY,447720,449280,on the ground those nukes might come
j8TLGaSPOzY,449280,450479,into play and that's something we're
j8TLGaSPOzY,450479,452099,really trying to avoid
j8TLGaSPOzY,452099,454500,but you could do that versus Syria
j8TLGaSPOzY,454500,458400,really easily now the Syrian rebels are
j8TLGaSPOzY,458400,460259,not benefiting large-scale from American
j8TLGaSPOzY,460259,462539,Equipment because we don't want to piss
j8TLGaSPOzY,462539,465479,off turkey but I can see based on
j8TLGaSPOzY,465479,467580,certain circumstances
j8TLGaSPOzY,467580,469500,those alliances shifting
j8TLGaSPOzY,469500,471000,and if you get the Kurds running around
j8TLGaSPOzY,471000,473220,with some hammars well that would be a
j8TLGaSPOzY,473220,475620,real problem for Damascus so these are
j8TLGaSPOzY,475620,477720,the two pillars of American strategic
j8TLGaSPOzY,477720,479880,policy in the future working through
j8TLGaSPOzY,479880,482220,third parties fully leveraging American
j8TLGaSPOzY,482220,484080,industrial infrastructure and Technical
j8TLGaSPOzY,484080,486660,capacity and on the other side for a
j8TLGaSPOzY,486660,488580,more pointed application Special
j8TLGaSPOzY,488580,490620,Operation Forces doing a lot of
j8TLGaSPOzY,490620,492960,disruptions either Behind Enemy Lines or
j8TLGaSPOzY,492960,494099,in terms of
j8TLGaSPOzY,494099,496380,acting sort of like a guidance counselor
j8TLGaSPOzY,496380,498360,for militant groups that are already in
j8TLGaSPOzY,498360,499379,the region
j8TLGaSPOzY,499379,501840,this is going to last until such time as
j8TLGaSPOzY,501840,503639,the United States has gotten over its
j8TLGaSPOzY,503639,506099,gun shy period whenever we have a big
j8TLGaSPOzY,506099,507780,military conflict especially if it
j8TLGaSPOzY,507780,510840,doesn't go well we take a breather and
j8TLGaSPOzY,510840,512219,we have to kind of reintegrate the
j8TLGaSPOzY,512219,514140,military with Society to the point that
j8TLGaSPOzY,514140,516240,we are willing to send the tens of
j8TLGaSPOzY,516240,517680,thousands hundreds of thousands of
j8TLGaSPOzY,517680,520320,troops abroad again that is not going to
j8TLGaSPOzY,520320,521640,happen to the United States I would
j8TLGaSPOzY,521640,525060,guess before 2040. so this is the future
j8TLGaSPOzY,525060,527820,of American intervention for at least
j8TLGaSPOzY,527820,529560,the next 18 years
j8TLGaSPOzY,529560,531600,and as we're seeing in Ukraine it's
j8TLGaSPOzY,531600,533880,definitely a model that works okay
j8TLGaSPOzY,533880,537800,that's it for me until next time
