bK397YwduhQ,0,"Hey everybody Peter zein, here coming to you from Colorado uh today I wanted to look at the financial situation from a slightly different anger angle and that's one of Workforce"
bK397YwduhQ,1,So one of the things that happens when capital is really cheap for a really long time and everyone can borrow at ridiculous rates and the stock market is booming
bK397YwduhQ,2,"Is you get a lot of money that is chasing projects that were probably, let's just call them risky? Not necessarily stupid, but there was an investment idea behind them and it probably was okay, but it required either really really high payouts or really really cheap money to give it a try, and that is something we have seen throughout the tech, space, uh Silicon Valley and All that now of going back for 15 20 years and it's been a kind of a great environment, because you've had really cheap Capital, you've had the Millennials coming of age and being in their 20s and then their 30s, providing an ample Workforce"
bK397YwduhQ,3,"That is, tech savvy"
bK397YwduhQ,4,"You marry those two things together and you can take a little bit of a longer range with your investment strategy, because you don't have to get the payout right away, because the costs for taking the long term are low because the cost of the money to make It run in the short and the midterm are low, and that allows companies like meta or Amazon or Google to just Hoover up huge amounts of the workforce because they can afford to do so, and the stock market plays a role"
bK397YwduhQ,5,"Because people see these as long range world, changing Technologies, implementing new things and greater efficiencies and basically making life better for everyone and they're willing to put their money behind that stock markets go to the roof"
bK397YwduhQ,6,It also works in Reverse
bK397YwduhQ,7,"When the money starts to become more expensive, then nothing that worked before Works any longer"
bK397YwduhQ,8,"All of a sudden, the long term looks a little risky and the short and the midterm gets a lot more expensive, and so we are seeing all of the tech companies now shedding jobs that they've spent 15 years building up, in some cases we're looking at these Big companies removing over 20, maybe even 30 percent of their Workforce in just a matter of weeks now this is good and this is bad"
bK397YwduhQ,9,The Bad is the bad is pretty straightforward
bK397YwduhQ,10,"Uh the value preposition for Silicon Valley, just isn't there compared to what it was recently and for companies that have been trading as tech companies on betting on being transformational but get their income from not Tech methods"
bK397YwduhQ,11,"The problem is very, very substantial, so when I think of companies like Tesla that have been imagined as tech companies financed as tech companies invested in as tech companies, but their income follows a more traditional manufacturing model, especially since Tesla has now gobbled up all of the Subsidies that were on available for early EV adoption, we are probably going to see some catastrophic losses, not just in terms of jobs, but the stock market value of the company as well, and the market really hasn't digested that"
bK397YwduhQ,12,"Yet, let's focus on some of the good, though Google and Amazon and the like have been hoovering up American labor now for years over a decade and that's made it very difficult for small and medium companies who generally have a little bit more of a problem accessing Capital markets to get qualified labor to help with any Tech related projects well by my math Silicon Valley has laid off over a hundred thousand people in just the last two months"
bK397YwduhQ,13,"These are people with programming experience and software experience and operationalization experience who, for the first time in their professional careers or discovering they actually have to go out and sell themselves to a potential employer in perhaps a bit of a market downturn"
bK397YwduhQ,14,"Well, if you are any company that has not had like kind of the tuck Mantra going on all of a sudden, there is a labor force out there that is available"
bK397YwduhQ,15,So are we heading into a downturn of Sam flavor? That doesn't seem like to be very controversial anymore
bK397YwduhQ,16,"Will it be a full-on recession, can't rule it out, and I understand why a lot of people think that it might already be here, but that doesn't mean that everyone Falls at once, just because Capital has become more expensive, doesn't mean it's become more expensive for everyone"
bK397YwduhQ,17,"Equally and the small business administration is a group within the American federal government who provides below Market Capital costs for smaller companies, which means we might actually be seeing an explosion of economic activity"
bK397YwduhQ,18,"Hiring-Based economic activity for smaller companies who are now looking to implement 10 to 15 years of technological advancement, more or less on the cheap in a very short period of time, and for the first time in recent history, the labor is actually there to do it"
bK397YwduhQ,19,"Okay, that's it for me until next time,"
