XY6o599W9jE,0,"Hey everybody Peter zein, here coming toyou from San Diego today, I wanted totalk about the rail dispute that isabout to generate a strike in the UnitedStates uh rail in the United States, isused for any sort of large type of bulktransport, whether it's fuel or food orcontainers that Have been moved from theports, specifically in things that aretransferred from either the Pacificcoast inward for ant consumption, orthings like fertilizer, that come fromthe Gulf Coast up to the Midwestit's, an important part of the systemit's, the second largest transportcapacity"
XY6o599W9jE,1,The United States has in termsof ton miles and it matters for tworeasons
XY6o599W9jE,2,"First, my perennial one-man waragainst, the Jones act"
XY6o599W9jE,3,"We used to ship alot of things via water, but with theJones act"
XY6o599W9jE,4,"We now can only ship itemsbetween, two American ports, that areAmerica on vessels that are Americanowned operated"
XY6o599W9jE,5,"Captained and crude andthat has led us to reduce the use of thewaterways by in excess of 99 almostcondemning uh, our Maritime transportsystem, which is the best natural Networkin the world toirrelevance"
XY6o599W9jE,6,"As long as that is, the caserail is the only way they can movethings in size and if we had somethinglike the Jones act for rail, the railsystem would shut down"
XY6o599W9jE,7,"If we hadsomething like the Jones act, fortransport no more Toyota, no moreMercedes or BMW or Fujitsu or any of theothers, so it gives you an idea of howdistortionary it issecond, it's political"
XY6o599W9jE,8,"If we were under adifferent time frame, say Obama earlierwe would have had a very differentresolution here, because we probablywould have had some strike Bustersalready been ordered in by the federalgovernment, because the rail system is socritical to the American economicfunctioninghowever"
XY6o599W9jE,9,We'Re not going to see that ifanything
XY6o599W9jE,10,"We'Re going to see thisAdministration, citing with the unionsand"
XY6o599W9jE,11,"The reason is, is that we are anattorney of the political system, nowevery generation or two, the factionsthat make up the political parties"
XY6o599W9jE,12,Inthe United States move around and inmany ways
XY6o599W9jE,13,This is not a bug
XY6o599W9jE,14,It'S afeature of the system
XY6o599W9jE,15,We have atwo-party system because that's what ourconstitution more or less requires anddictates
XY6o599W9jE,16,"We have a first past the postsingle member district system, which is afancy way of saying that when you go tovote you vote for a specific person"
XY6o599W9jE,17,"Whowill represent a specific geographyyou're, not voting for a party or votingfor an individual and that makesAmerican political parties relativelyweak compared to say how they are inEurope or Asiaand"
XY6o599W9jE,18,"That means that we get factions, ofthese, Independent party, candidateswithin, the umbrella of the big tents, ofthe Democrats and the Republicans and astechnology evolves as the economy"
XY6o599W9jE,19,"Shiftsas demography changes those factionsrise and fall in power and sometimesonce a generation or two the factionslose power, or gain power to a scale thatdisrupts the entire system, this hashappened to us six times before the lastbig time it shifted in the 1930s"
XY6o599W9jE,20,All theAfrican Americans were Republicans andall of big business
XY6o599W9jE,21,"Were Democrats andobviously, that's not the world we're intodaywell"
XY6o599W9jE,22,"In the last 30 years, we've had therise of alter globalization and now it'scollapsed the rise of China and now it'scollapsed the rise of InformationTechnology uh"
XY6o599W9jE,23,"The the Green Revolutionall of these things have happened in arelatively short period of timecoinciding, with the collapse of theSoviet Union and now the return of theRussians"
XY6o599W9jE,24,"Of course, we're going to manageour political system differently and sothe factions are once again in motionand the faction that is currently in themiddle of a tug of war between theDemocrats and the Republicans isorganized labor"
XY6o599W9jE,25,"So any issue that theunions don't like is not something thatanyone is going to raise at the nationallevel because they feel they need thatfaction, that's a lot of votesand, so whether it's Union issues withthe Jones Actwhether, it's Union issues with RailYards and whether it's issues ofimmigration the unions - Are againstchanges in those systems, and so they aregoing to resist and as long as that, isgoing on, we are not going to see aresolutionso with the Rail Yards"
XY6o599W9jE,26,"I do expect thefederal government to get involved, buton the side of the unions and that hasnothing to do with the fact that Bidenhas generally been pro-union"
XY6o599W9jE,27,"It'S justbecause, that's where the politics arefalling to both sides"
XY6o599W9jE,28,"If anything, we'reactually seeing the Republican partyright now arguing for the unions, whichis a weird place to be in but againeverything is in motion all right"
XY6o599W9jE,29,Thathopefully explains it
XY6o599W9jE,30,"That'S it whoaseagull! That'S it for me until next time,"
