XY6o599W9jE,0,"Hey everybody Peter zein, here coming to you from San Diego today I wanted to talk about the rail dispute that is about to generate a strike in the United States"
XY6o599W9jE,1,Uh rail in the United States is used for any sort of large type of bulk transport
XY6o599W9jE,2,"Whether it's fuel or food or containers that have been moved from the ports, specifically in things that are transferred from either the Pacific coast, inward for ant consumption or things like fertilizer, that come from the Gulf Coast up to the Midwest"
XY6o599W9jE,3,It'S an important part of the system
XY6o599W9jE,4,It'S the second largest transport capacity
XY6o599W9jE,5,"The United States has in terms of ton miles, and it matters for two reasons"
XY6o599W9jE,6,"First, my perennial one-man war against the Jones act"
XY6o599W9jE,7,"We used to ship a lot of things via water, but with the Jones act we now can only ship items between two American ports that are America on vessels that are American owned, operated, captained and crude, and that has led us to reduce the use of the Waterways, by in excess of 99, almost condemning uh our Maritime transport system, which is the best natural Network in the world to irrelevance"
XY6o599W9jE,8,"As long as that is the case, rail is the only way they can move things in size, and if we had something like the Jones act for rail, the rail system would shut down"
XY6o599W9jE,9,"If we had something like the Jones act for transport, no more Toyota"
XY6o599W9jE,10,"No more Mercedes or BMW or Fujitsu or any of the others, so it gives you an idea of how distortionary it is"
XY6o599W9jE,11,"Second, it's political"
XY6o599W9jE,12,"If we were under a different time frame, say Obama earlier, we would have had a very different resolution here, because we probably would have had some strike Busters already been ordered in by the federal government, because the rail system is so critical to the American economic functioning"
XY6o599W9jE,13,"However, we're not going to see that, if anything, we're going to see this Administration, citing with the unions and the reason is, is that we are an attorney of the political system"
XY6o599W9jE,14,Now every generation or two the factions that make up the political parties in the United States move around and in many ways this is not a bug
XY6o599W9jE,15,It'S a feature of the system
XY6o599W9jE,16,"We have a two-party system because that's what our constitution more or less, requires and dictates"
XY6o599W9jE,17,"We have a first past the post single member district system, which is a fancy way of saying that when you go to vote, you vote for a specific person who will represent a specific geography"
XY6o599W9jE,18,"You'Re not voting for a party or voting for an individual, and that makes American political parties relatively weak compared to say how they are in Europe or Asia"
XY6o599W9jE,19,And that means that we get factions of these Independent party candidates within the umbrella of the big tents of the Democrats and the Republicans and as technology evolves as the economy shifts as demography changes
XY6o599W9jE,20,"Those factions rise and fall in power, and sometimes once a generation or two, the factions lose power or gain power to a scale that disrupts the entire system"
XY6o599W9jE,21,This has happened to us six times before the last big time it shifted in the 1930s
XY6o599W9jE,22,"All the African Americans were Republicans and all of big business were Democrats, and obviously that's not the world we're in today"
XY6o599W9jE,23,"Well, in the last 30 years, we've had the rise of alter globalization and now it's collapsed"
XY6o599W9jE,24,The rise of China and now it's collapsed
XY6o599W9jE,25,"The rise of Information Technology uh, the the Green Revolution - all of these things have happened in a relatively short period of time, coinciding with the collapse of the Soviet Union and now the return of the Russians"
XY6o599W9jE,26,"Of course, we're going to manage our political system differently, and so the factions are once again in motion and the faction that is currently in the middle of a tug of war between the Democrats and the Republicans is organized labor"
XY6o599W9jE,27,So any issue that the unions don't like is not something that anyone is going to raise at the national level because they feel they need that faction
XY6o599W9jE,28,"That'S a lot of votes and so whether it's Union issues with the Jones Act, whether it's Union issues with Rail Yards and whether it's issues of immigration, the unions are against changes in those systems, and so they are going to resist"
XY6o599W9jE,29,"And as long as that is going on, we are not going to see a resolution so with the Rail Yards"
XY6o599W9jE,30,"I do expect the federal government to get involved, but on the side of the unions, and that has nothing to do with the fact that Biden has generally been pro-union"
XY6o599W9jE,31,"It'S just because that's where the politics are falling to both sides, if anything, we're actually seeing the Republican party right now arguing for the unions, which is a weird place to be in but again, everything is in motion all right"
XY6o599W9jE,32,"That, hopefully explains it"
XY6o599W9jE,33,That'S it whoa seagull! That'S it for me until next time
