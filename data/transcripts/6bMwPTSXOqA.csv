6bMwPTSXOqA,179,3720,hello from Snowy Colorado uh one of the
6bMwPTSXOqA,3720,5400,questions I've been getting a lot today
6bMwPTSXOqA,5400,7080,is when we will know who's going to win
6bMwPTSXOqA,7080,8519,the Ukraine war and when it's going to
6bMwPTSXOqA,8519,11040,be over I can't answer that but I can
6bMwPTSXOqA,11040,13259,give you a time as to when we will know
6bMwPTSXOqA,13259,15240,and that's going to be next to May so
6bMwPTSXOqA,15240,17160,there's three things in play number one
6bMwPTSXOqA,17160,19140,the ukrainians have captured a huge
6bMwPTSXOqA,19140,20760,amount of Russian equipment first in the
6bMwPTSXOqA,20760,22680,car cover offensive then in the Battle
6bMwPTSXOqA,22680,24720,of visium and then finally most recently
6bMwPTSXOqA,24720,26539,in the Battle of Kirsten
6bMwPTSXOqA,26539,29580,collectively they have captured roughly
6bMwPTSXOqA,29580,32700,double to Triple the total amount of
6bMwPTSXOqA,32700,34680,Weaponry in terms of artillery and tanks
6bMwPTSXOqA,34680,36660,and ammo that they had at the beginning
6bMwPTSXOqA,36660,39420,of the war so that is at least twice
6bMwPTSXOqA,39420,42420,what NATO has transferred so after a
6bMwPTSXOqA,42420,44579,winter of doing a whole lot of deferred
6bMwPTSXOqA,44579,46879,maintenance we're looking at the Ukraine
6bMwPTSXOqA,46879,50039,military being roughly four to six times
6bMwPTSXOqA,50039,52920,as powerful by next may as it is now
6bMwPTSXOqA,52920,55440,totally different sort of combatant
6bMwPTSXOqA,55440,58500,second the Russians have mobilized and
6bMwPTSXOqA,58500,60300,by may they will have thrown at least
6bMwPTSXOqA,60300,62039,500
6bMwPTSXOqA,62039,64500,000 troops into the front lines and yes
6bMwPTSXOqA,64500,66299,they will be badly trained and yes they
6bMwPTSXOqA,66299,68340,will be badly equipped and yes they will
6bMwPTSXOqA,68340,71159,be badly LED and yes they're just not
6bMwPTSXOqA,71159,74100,gonna do well but there's 500 000 of
6bMwPTSXOqA,74100,75659,them and you know what I call troops
6bMwPTSXOqA,75659,79140,like this of this quality Russian there
6bMwPTSXOqA,79140,81420,is not a single war in the entirety of
6bMwPTSXOqA,81420,83340,Russian history where the first year of
6bMwPTSXOqA,83340,84600,it looks any different from what we're
6bMwPTSXOqA,84600,86520,seeing right now the first year is
6bMwPTSXOqA,86520,89640,always an absolute show and then
6bMwPTSXOqA,89640,91560,the Russians mobilize and throw bodies
6bMwPTSXOqA,91560,93119,at the problem until it just goes away
6bMwPTSXOqA,93119,95820,and half the time that works so by the
6bMwPTSXOqA,95820,97259,time we get to May both sides will be
6bMwPTSXOqA,97259,99479,ready for a real Duke out the other
6bMwPTSXOqA,99479,101159,reason we have to wait for May is the
6bMwPTSXOqA,101159,103799,weather now Ukraine is primarily step
6bMwPTSXOqA,103799,105720,particularly in the South and the East
6bMwPTSXOqA,105720,107400,which means that they don't get a lot of
6bMwPTSXOqA,107400,108960,moisture and what they do get happens in
6bMwPTSXOqA,108960,111240,the fall winter and spring and when
6bMwPTSXOqA,111240,112979,you're talking about fall and Inter and
6bMwPTSXOqA,112979,115079,the beginning of winter that means a
6bMwPTSXOqA,115079,116880,whole lot of of mud that really slows
6bMwPTSXOqA,116880,119040,down operations for all sides it's not
6bMwPTSXOqA,119040,121560,that the war is going to stop but in
6bMwPTSXOqA,121560,123420,October and November it's muddy and it's
6bMwPTSXOqA,123420,125040,just hard to move around with vehicles
6bMwPTSXOqA,125040,128039,when you get into December and January
6bMwPTSXOqA,128039,130500,and February the ground is frozen hard
6bMwPTSXOqA,130500,132780,and you can do normal operations and in
6bMwPTSXOqA,132780,134520,that sort of time frame I expect the
6bMwPTSXOqA,134520,136500,ukrainians to do very very well because
6bMwPTSXOqA,136500,138180,they actually have more tanks in theater
6bMwPTSXOqA,138180,139980,than the Russians do and they're
6bMwPTSXOqA,139980,141480,certainly a lot more flexible with their
6bMwPTSXOqA,141480,144360,supply lines but then we have another
6bMwPTSXOqA,144360,146340,mud season when we get into March and
6bMwPTSXOqA,146340,148080,April as things start to thawing you get
6bMwPTSXOqA,148080,149760,the spring rains that's going to slow
6bMwPTSXOqA,149760,153660,things down again but may by May they're
6bMwPTSXOqA,153660,155340,both going to be ready to Duke it out
6bMwPTSXOqA,155340,157200,for real and it'll be a very different
6bMwPTSXOqA,157200,159239,sort of conflict and if you've seen my
6bMwPTSXOqA,159239,160920,previous videos you know that Crimea is
6bMwPTSXOqA,160920,163379,fully in play so most of this fighting
6bMwPTSXOqA,163379,165959,is probably going to happen in the Don
6bMwPTSXOqA,165959,167580,boss in the luhansk and the Knox
6bMwPTSXOqA,167580,169019,provinces
6bMwPTSXOqA,169019,171060,that's when we'll know because it's not
6bMwPTSXOqA,171060,173220,going to take long for us to find out if
6bMwPTSXOqA,173220,175140,the Russians numbers versus the
6bMwPTSXOqA,175140,177180,ukrainian's quality is enough to move
6bMwPTSXOqA,177180,179280,the needle one way or the other so next
6bMwPTSXOqA,179280,182099,May that's when we know that's it for me
6bMwPTSXOqA,182099,184879,until next time
