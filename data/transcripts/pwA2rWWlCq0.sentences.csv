pwA2rWWlCq0,0,"Hey everyone Peter zein, here coming toyou with the latest installment of ourUkraine Consequences series in the firstcouple we went into the situation thatthe Europeans are facing with energy nowI want to talk a little bit more aboutwhat's going on in terms of of theoverall strategic situation"
pwA2rWWlCq0,1,"Particularlyfrom, the American point of view: nowthere have only been three countries: inthe history of the United States, thathave ever actually threatened the UnitedStates with absolute National Oblivionand, so whatever policy set this or thatPresident might want to have that's openor closed or based on trade or strategicissues"
pwA2rWWlCq0,2,"There are three countries: thathave always been standouts uh, the firstone is the United Kingdom"
pwA2rWWlCq0,3,The UnitedKingdom is the only country that hasinvaded the United States and it did sotwice
pwA2rWWlCq0,4,"It'S the only Power we've everfaced from the Eastern Hemisphere, that'sactually ever had boots on the groundswithin, the Continental, United States andso, there's always been a specialplace in the American Heart for orcultural parents and decision afterdecision after decision that was madenot just in the early decades, butthroughout the 19Th century in the firsthalf of the 20th century was about howto handle Britain in a special way"
pwA2rWWlCq0,5,Sothat the Brits finally admit that theUnited States has grown up and is nolonger
pwA2rWWlCq0,6,A teenageruh Nations could be very familial and sothat came to a head with World War IIwhen
pwA2rWWlCq0,7,"It became apparent to everyone thatthe Brits, really couldn't fight the warwithout American assistance and we hadlend lease and for the Lolo price of 40odd wildly outdated and technologicallyincapacitated destroyers"
pwA2rWWlCq0,8,The UnitedStates forced the UK to give up theentirety of its entire militaryfootprint in the Western Hemisphereon top of that
pwA2rWWlCq0,9,Once we got to theBretton Wood talks at the end of the warto figure out what the post-war orderwas we not only did not give the Britsany special dispensations
pwA2rWWlCq0,10,"We actuallycharge them in terms of interest, ontheir loans"
pwA2rWWlCq0,11,Excuse me even more than wecharge all the other alliesand that kind of put the United Kingdominto the position that it is today as anAmerican Ally that strategically cannotfunction independently of the UnitedStates uh
pwA2rWWlCq0,12,"There was kind of one morelittle bit of underlining that happenedwith, the Suez Crisis, where the UnitedStates actually threatened publicly thatthe Brits would have to pay up on allthe World War II loans at once, whichwould have thrown them into a depressionand even offered publicly to Ally, withthe Soviets"
pwA2rWWlCq0,13,"Briefly, in order to driveBritish forces out of Suez and that wasreally kind of the last hurray for theEmpire as an independent entityuh, the second country was Mexico"
pwA2rWWlCq0,14,Mexicoand the United States shared a borderand between The Texican rebellion andthe Mexican-American War
pwA2rWWlCq0,15,"There was aconcern that Mexican troops were goingto, be able to punchthrough the Texas territories especiallyin the early days of the Texan Rebellionwhen"
pwA2rWWlCq0,16,"It didn't look like it was going: tobe, successful and capture New Orleansand"
pwA2rWWlCq0,17,"If that had happened, then the entireAmerican hold on the middle continentwould have gone away and that would havemeant everything from Ohio to Nebraskawould have basically been Mexicanterritory and the West Coast would havenever happened"
pwA2rWWlCq0,18,So the Mexican-AmericanWar happened and the Americans ended upan annexing about half of what had atone point been Mexican territory fastforward that a century and we glared ateach other from time to time
pwA2rWWlCq0,19,"But reallydidn't have relations until we got tothe 1980s and then under Reagan, andeventually under Herbert Walker, Bush wenegotiated"
pwA2rWWlCq0,20,"The NAFTA Accords, which arenow fully in place and the two countriesare each other's highest demographicintermingling factor and top tradingpartner, and I don't want to suggest thatthe relationship - is all sunshine andtacos all the time, but we're definitelythrough the worst of it and we'rebuilding"
pwA2rWWlCq0,21,"A former partnership with arenewed set of expectations, just like wehave with the United Kingdom and thenthere's the Third Country uh, the SovietUnion, which started pointing nuclearweapons at the United States as early as1950"
pwA2rWWlCq0,22,""
pwA2rWWlCq0,23,"The challenge posed by the Sovietswas always different uh from theprevious two, because with the UnitedKingdom it was ultimately not a culturalissue"
pwA2rWWlCq0,24,We were from the same
pwA2rWWlCq0,25,Culturalstock was an issue of control and in theMexican issue it was two neighborsstruggling to see who was the dominantpower and it was never going to be abattle for the to the death
pwA2rWWlCq0,26,It was itwas a battle to see who was going to bethe big manbut with the Soviets
pwA2rWWlCq0,27,"It was economic, itwas, strategic"
pwA2rWWlCq0,28,It was ideological and itwas about your ability to Simply existyou know
pwA2rWWlCq0,29,"Nukes do that to theconversationso we always knew from the beginning, ofthe American Soviet conflict of the ColdWarthat"
pwA2rWWlCq0,30,"There could really only be one andso when the Soviet Union fell in 1992there was more than a little bit ofCelebration, and there was this wonderfulpart in the 1990s when we thought youknow, maybe maybe we can recreate Russiain a different way to become differentin, some way where we Don'T have this badblood between us and we can be a degreeof Partnersuh and When Vladimir Putin becamepresident in 1999"
pwA2rWWlCq0,31,"Excuse me primeminister in 1999, president 2000 thatgeneral idea that maybe we really canall get along got a lot of lift becausePutin in his early days was aninveterate Westernerand"
pwA2rWWlCq0,32,"There was actually open discussionmaybe, not all that serious butdiscussion about Russia, perhaps one dayjoining, the European Union in NATOclearly"
pwA2rWWlCq0,33,It didn't go that wayand
pwA2rWWlCq0,34,"So what we've been dealing with nowis kind of a reversion to the normbecause, the Russian ethnicity, is theonly, one that has ever actuallythreatened the United States withphysical annihilationit's, difficult to see any way out, ofthis, where we agree to try to get alongagain, especially now that the Putingovernment Has repeatedly brought up thenuclear threat, time and time and timeagain, it's like the one way to get theAmericans attention"
pwA2rWWlCq0,35,"Although I wouldargue from the American point of viewAmerica's, attention is not what you'reafter, if you're, trying to prosecute awar in your corner of the world and notinvite American intervention, if anythingit brings us to the table in a very badway from your point of view and we'veseen that Time and time againwhat's going on here is in many waysa wonderful opportunity"
pwA2rWWlCq0,36,You know removethe morals from the equation: remove thehuman suffering from the equation for amoment
pwA2rWWlCq0,37,The United States is beingpresented with an opportunity to drive astake through the Russian heart foreverthink about what the United States hascommitted to this war
pwA2rWWlCq0,38,"To this point, abunch of artillery a bunch of stingers abunch of javelinsthese are not weapon systems that as arule the United States uses, ourartillery systems are much longer"
pwA2rWWlCq0,39,Rangenone of those have been handed over wedon't use Stingers because we have anAir Force
pwA2rWWlCq0,40,We don't use a lot of javelinsbecause
pwA2rWWlCq0,41,"We have tanks, the WeaponsSystems that the United States hastransferred to Ukraine are for the mostpart Surplus and in many cases wereslotted for disposal"
pwA2rWWlCq0,42,"So if anything theukrainians are doing as a budgetarysolid here by throwing them into theteeth of the only country that has everthreatened the United States withannihilationand, if, if the ukrainians can win, thisit is difficult to see"
pwA2rWWlCq0,43,"Russia in itscurrent forms surviving more than adecade or two, the Russian population isdying out"
pwA2rWWlCq0,44,We don't have great databecause about a decade ago
pwA2rWWlCq0,45,"The Russiansjust started lying about all theirdemographic data, but at that time we sawa demographic collapse in progress"
pwA2rWWlCq0,46,"Thatwas, the worst in human history, sincethen they've been surpassed by theChinese, but that's a topic for anothermomentif"
pwA2rWWlCq0,47,The old data is true
pwA2rWWlCq0,48,"We were alreadylooking at the Russian ethnicity, losinghold of the territories"
pwA2rWWlCq0,49,"We now know asRussia sometime between 2045 and 2070probably, and it's kind of iffy when youget to demographics and that kind ofscale and there are other ethnicitieswithin, the Russian space, no notably thetatars and the other turkic minoritieslike"
pwA2rWWlCq0,50,"The bashkiers or the chechens whoare actually experiencing robustpopulationgrowth, so people in the United States onthe right sometimes like to talk aboutreplacement theory"
pwA2rWWlCq0,51,In the case of theRussian space
pwA2rWWlCq0,52,It'S not quite replacementTheory
pwA2rWWlCq0,53,It'S just
pwA2rWWlCq0,54,"You have zones that arehaving explosive population growth, andthen zones that are having explosivepopulation collapse"
pwA2rWWlCq0,55,"They don't overlapthey, don't over mingle"
pwA2rWWlCq0,56,All that much butit does mean that many of theprincipalities that the Russians hadconquered in centuries pastare getting very close to the pointwhere
pwA2rWWlCq0,57,They could chart out a differentdemographic economic and strategicfuture from Russiaand they're on the wrong side of naturalborders
pwA2rWWlCq0,58,"So you could have a robustindependent totter stand right next to adying Russian Empire, and in that sort ofenvironment it is impossible for thecenter to hold and all the United Stateshas to do to make this work is help theukrainians out a little bitnow"
pwA2rWWlCq0,59,"If anything, I am sugar"
pwA2rWWlCq0,60,"Coating thesituation for the Russians here, becauseif, you remember back to 1992 Ukraineused to be part of the Soviet Union"
pwA2rWWlCq0,61,"Samewith Belarus same with Latvia, same withGeorgia same with Kazakhstan and nowwith the exception of Belarus, all of theother 15 constituent States, the the 14plus Russia"
pwA2rWWlCq0,62,"That used to be part of theSoviet Union all, but one of them areeither pathologically hostile to AllThings, Moscoware neutral or in the case of Ukraineare, actively fighting back in many wayswhat we're"
pwA2rWWlCq0,63,Seeing here is the finalCivil War of the Soviet system and 100of
pwA2rWWlCq0,64,The casualties are being felt byformer Soviet citizens from an Americanpoint of view
pwA2rWWlCq0,65,"What we're seeing is thesingle greatest threat ever to theAmerican Republic is in the process, ofdefenestrating itselfhard, to go wrong with that"
pwA2rWWlCq0,66,"Okay, next upwe're going to talk about what thismeans for American tactics and strategymoving forward, see you soon"
