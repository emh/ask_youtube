6bMwPTSXOqA,1,"I can't answer that, but I cangive you a time as to when we will knowand that's going to be next to May sothere's three things in play: number onethe ukrainians have captured a hugeamount of Russian equipment first in thecar cover offensive, then in the Battleof visium, and Then finally, most recentlyin, the Battle of Kirstencollectively"
6bMwPTSXOqA,2,"They have captured roughlydouble to Triple the total amount, ofWeaponry in terms of artillery and tanksand ammo that they had at the beginningof the war"
6bMwPTSXOqA,3,So that is at least twicewhat
6bMwPTSXOqA,4,"Nato has transferred so after awinter of doing a whole lot of deferredmaintenance we're looking at the Ukrainemilitary being roughly four to six timesas powerful by next may, as it is nowtotally different sort of combatantsecond, the Russians have mobilized andby may they will have thrown at least500000 troops Into the front lines and yesthey will be badly trained and yes, theywill be badly equipped, and, yes, they willbe badly LED and yes they're, just notgonna do well, but there's 500 000 ofthem"
6bMwPTSXOqA,5,"And you know what I call troopslike this of this quality: Russian thereis, not a single war in the entirety"
6bMwPTSXOqA,6,"Ofrussian history, where the first year ofit looks any different from what we'reseeing right now, the first year isalways an absolute show and thenthe Russians mobilize and throw bodiesat the problem until it just goes"
6bMwPTSXOqA,7,Awayand half the time that works
6bMwPTSXOqA,8,"So by thetime we get to, May both sides will beready for a real Duke out"
6bMwPTSXOqA,9,The otherreason we have to wait for May is theweather
6bMwPTSXOqA,10,"Now Ukraine is primarily stepparticularly in the South, and the Eastwhich means that they don't get a lot ofmoisture and what they do"
6bMwPTSXOqA,11,"Get happens, inthe fall winter and spring and whenyou're talking about fall and Inter andthe, beginning of winter"
6bMwPTSXOqA,12,That means awhole lot of of mud that really slowsdown operations for all sides
6bMwPTSXOqA,13,"It'S notthat the war is going to stop, but inOctober and November"
6bMwPTSXOqA,14,It'S muddy and it'sjust hard to move around with vehicleswhen you get into December and Januaryand February
6bMwPTSXOqA,15,"The ground is frozen, hardand you can do normal operations and inthat sort of time frame"
6bMwPTSXOqA,16,"I expect theukrainians to do very, very well"
6bMwPTSXOqA,17,Becausethey actually have more tanks in theaterthan
6bMwPTSXOqA,18,"The Russians do and they'recertainly a lot more flexible with theirsupply lines, but then we have anothermud season when we get into March andApril"
6bMwPTSXOqA,19,"As things start to thawing, you getthe spring rains, that's going to slowthings down again but may by May they'reboth going to be ready to Duke it"
6bMwPTSXOqA,20,"Outfor, real and it'll be a very differentsort of conflict and, if you've seen myprevious videos, you know that Crimea isfully in play"
6bMwPTSXOqA,21,"So most of this fightingis, probably going to happen in the Donboss in the luhansk and the Knoxprovincesthat's"
6bMwPTSXOqA,22,"When we'll know, because it's notgoing to take long for us to find out ifthe Russians, numbers versus theukrainian's quality is enough to movethe needle one way or the other, so nextMay, that's when we know that's it for meuntil next time"
