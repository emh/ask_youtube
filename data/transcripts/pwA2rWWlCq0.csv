pwA2rWWlCq0,120,2159,hey everyone Peter zein here coming to
pwA2rWWlCq0,2159,3540,you with the latest installment of our
pwA2rWWlCq0,3540,6540,Ukraine Consequences series in the first
pwA2rWWlCq0,6540,8099,couple we went into the situation that
pwA2rWWlCq0,8099,10080,the Europeans are facing with energy now
pwA2rWWlCq0,10080,11700,I want to talk a little bit more about
pwA2rWWlCq0,11700,14040,what's going on in terms of of the
pwA2rWWlCq0,14040,16619,overall strategic situation particularly
pwA2rWWlCq0,16619,18960,from the American point of view now
pwA2rWWlCq0,18960,21600,there have only been three countries in
pwA2rWWlCq0,21600,23520,the history of the United States that
pwA2rWWlCq0,23520,25019,have ever actually threatened the United
pwA2rWWlCq0,25019,27539,States with absolute National Oblivion
pwA2rWWlCq0,27539,30779,and so whatever policy set this or that
pwA2rWWlCq0,30779,32398,President might want to have that's open
pwA2rWWlCq0,32398,35160,or closed or based on trade or strategic
pwA2rWWlCq0,35160,37140,issues there are three countries that
pwA2rWWlCq0,37140,39300,have always been standouts uh the first
pwA2rWWlCq0,39300,41040,one is the United Kingdom the United
pwA2rWWlCq0,41040,42300,Kingdom is the only country that has
pwA2rWWlCq0,42300,43980,invaded the United States and it did so
pwA2rWWlCq0,43980,46020,twice it's the only Power we've ever
pwA2rWWlCq0,46020,47700,faced from the Eastern Hemisphere that's
pwA2rWWlCq0,47700,49440,actually ever had boots on the grounds
pwA2rWWlCq0,49440,52260,within the Continental United States and
pwA2rWWlCq0,52260,55739,so there's always been a special
pwA2rWWlCq0,55739,57899,place in the American Heart for or
pwA2rWWlCq0,57899,60539,cultural parents and decision after
pwA2rWWlCq0,60539,62219,decision after decision that was made
pwA2rWWlCq0,62219,63899,not just in the early decades but
pwA2rWWlCq0,63899,65460,throughout the 19th century in the first
pwA2rWWlCq0,65460,67200,half of the 20th century was about how
pwA2rWWlCq0,67200,69900,to handle Britain in a special way so
pwA2rWWlCq0,69900,73500,that the Brits finally admit that the
pwA2rWWlCq0,73500,75540,United States has grown up and is no
pwA2rWWlCq0,75540,77100,longer a teenager
pwA2rWWlCq0,77100,80400,uh Nations could be very familial and so
pwA2rWWlCq0,80400,84000,that came to a head with World War II
pwA2rWWlCq0,84000,85740,when it became apparent to everyone that
pwA2rWWlCq0,85740,88439,the Brits really couldn't fight the war
pwA2rWWlCq0,88439,90060,without American assistance and we had
pwA2rWWlCq0,90060,93720,lend lease and for the Lolo price of 40
pwA2rWWlCq0,93720,97400,odd wildly outdated and technologically
pwA2rWWlCq0,97400,100200,incapacitated destroyers the United
pwA2rWWlCq0,100200,102960,States forced the UK to give up the
pwA2rWWlCq0,102960,104579,entirety of its entire military
pwA2rWWlCq0,104579,107400,footprint in the Western Hemisphere
pwA2rWWlCq0,107400,109320,on top of that once we got to the
pwA2rWWlCq0,109320,110820,Bretton Wood talks at the end of the war
pwA2rWWlCq0,110820,112140,to figure out what the post-war order
pwA2rWWlCq0,112140,114720,was we not only did not give the Brits
pwA2rWWlCq0,114720,116280,any special dispensations we actually
pwA2rWWlCq0,116280,117720,charge them in terms of interest on
pwA2rWWlCq0,117720,120360,their loans excuse me even more than we
pwA2rWWlCq0,120360,121920,charge all the other allies
pwA2rWWlCq0,121920,123479,and that kind of put the United Kingdom
pwA2rWWlCq0,123479,125520,into the position that it is today as an
pwA2rWWlCq0,125520,128099,American Ally that strategically cannot
pwA2rWWlCq0,128099,130200,function independently of the United
pwA2rWWlCq0,130200,132239,States uh there was kind of one more
pwA2rWWlCq0,132239,133920,little bit of underlining that happened
pwA2rWWlCq0,133920,136080,with the Suez Crisis where the United
pwA2rWWlCq0,136080,138720,States actually threatened publicly that
pwA2rWWlCq0,138720,140160,the Brits would have to pay up on all
pwA2rWWlCq0,140160,142080,the World War II loans at once which
pwA2rWWlCq0,142080,143840,would have thrown them into a depression
pwA2rWWlCq0,143840,147180,and even offered publicly to Ally with
pwA2rWWlCq0,147180,149640,the Soviets briefly in order to drive
pwA2rWWlCq0,149640,152099,British forces out of Suez and that was
pwA2rWWlCq0,152099,153780,really kind of the last hurray for the
pwA2rWWlCq0,153780,156420,Empire as an independent entity
pwA2rWWlCq0,156420,159120,uh the second country was Mexico Mexico
pwA2rWWlCq0,159120,160800,and the United States shared a border
pwA2rWWlCq0,160800,163980,and between The Texican rebellion and
pwA2rWWlCq0,163980,166200,the Mexican-American War there was a
pwA2rWWlCq0,166200,167940,concern that Mexican troops were going
pwA2rWWlCq0,167940,169500,to be able to punch
pwA2rWWlCq0,169500,171780,through the Texas territories especially
pwA2rWWlCq0,171780,174000,in the early days of the Texan Rebellion
pwA2rWWlCq0,174000,174900,when it didn't look like it was going to
pwA2rWWlCq0,174900,176819,be successful and capture New Orleans
pwA2rWWlCq0,176819,179099,and if that had happened then the entire
pwA2rWWlCq0,179099,180840,American hold on the middle continent
pwA2rWWlCq0,180840,182280,would have gone away and that would have
pwA2rWWlCq0,182280,185280,meant everything from Ohio to Nebraska
pwA2rWWlCq0,185280,186660,would have basically been Mexican
pwA2rWWlCq0,186660,188459,territory and the West Coast would have
pwA2rWWlCq0,188459,190800,never happened so the Mexican-American
pwA2rWWlCq0,190800,192959,War happened and the Americans ended up
pwA2rWWlCq0,192959,195180,an annexing about half of what had at
pwA2rWWlCq0,195180,197760,one point been Mexican territory fast
pwA2rWWlCq0,197760,199680,forward that a century and we glared at
pwA2rWWlCq0,199680,201360,each other from time to time but really
pwA2rWWlCq0,201360,202920,didn't have relations until we got to
pwA2rWWlCq0,202920,205319,the 1980s and then under Reagan and
pwA2rWWlCq0,205319,207180,eventually under Herbert Walker Bush we
pwA2rWWlCq0,207180,209519,negotiated the NAFTA Accords which are
pwA2rWWlCq0,209519,211739,now fully in place and the two countries
pwA2rWWlCq0,211739,214440,are each other's highest demographic
pwA2rWWlCq0,214440,217140,intermingling factor and top trading
pwA2rWWlCq0,217140,218879,partner and I don't want to suggest that
pwA2rWWlCq0,218879,220860,the relationship is all sunshine and
pwA2rWWlCq0,220860,222959,tacos all the time but we're definitely
pwA2rWWlCq0,222959,224159,through the worst of it and we're
pwA2rWWlCq0,224159,226680,building a former partnership with a
pwA2rWWlCq0,226680,228360,renewed set of expectations just like we
pwA2rWWlCq0,228360,230400,have with the United Kingdom and then
pwA2rWWlCq0,230400,232680,there's the Third Country uh the Soviet
pwA2rWWlCq0,232680,234780,Union which started pointing nuclear
pwA2rWWlCq0,234780,237200,weapons at the United States as early as
pwA2rWWlCq0,237200,240659,1950. the challenge posed by the Soviets
pwA2rWWlCq0,240659,243360,was always different uh from the
pwA2rWWlCq0,243360,245280,previous two because with the United
pwA2rWWlCq0,245280,248580,Kingdom it was ultimately not a cultural
pwA2rWWlCq0,248580,250319,issue we were from the same cultural
pwA2rWWlCq0,250319,252480,stock was an issue of control and in the
pwA2rWWlCq0,252480,254099,Mexican issue it was two neighbors
pwA2rWWlCq0,254099,255540,struggling to see who was the dominant
pwA2rWWlCq0,255540,257220,power and it was never going to be a
pwA2rWWlCq0,257220,259019,battle for the to the death it was it
pwA2rWWlCq0,259019,260639,was a battle to see who was going to be
pwA2rWWlCq0,260639,261840,the big man
pwA2rWWlCq0,261840,264300,but with the Soviets it was economic it
pwA2rWWlCq0,264300,266699,was strategic it was ideological and it
pwA2rWWlCq0,266699,269400,was about your ability to Simply exist
pwA2rWWlCq0,269400,271380,you know nukes do that to the
pwA2rWWlCq0,271380,272759,conversation
pwA2rWWlCq0,272759,276000,so we always knew from the beginning of
pwA2rWWlCq0,276000,278100,the American Soviet conflict of the Cold
pwA2rWWlCq0,278100,279360,War
pwA2rWWlCq0,279360,281580,that there could really only be one and
pwA2rWWlCq0,281580,285000,so when the Soviet Union fell in 1992
pwA2rWWlCq0,285000,286440,there was more than a little bit of
pwA2rWWlCq0,286440,288300,Celebration and there was this wonderful
pwA2rWWlCq0,288300,290280,part in the 1990s when we thought you
pwA2rWWlCq0,290280,293160,know maybe maybe we can recreate Russia
pwA2rWWlCq0,293160,295440,in a different way to become different
pwA2rWWlCq0,295440,297900,in some way where we don't have this bad
pwA2rWWlCq0,297900,299520,blood between us and we can be a degree
pwA2rWWlCq0,299520,300600,of Partners
pwA2rWWlCq0,300600,302580,uh and When Vladimir Putin became
pwA2rWWlCq0,302580,305160,president in 1999 excuse me prime
pwA2rWWlCq0,305160,308400,minister in 1999 president 2000 that
pwA2rWWlCq0,308400,310259,general idea that maybe we really can
pwA2rWWlCq0,310259,312900,all get along got a lot of lift because
pwA2rWWlCq0,312900,314639,Putin in his early days was an
pwA2rWWlCq0,314639,316620,inveterate Westerner
pwA2rWWlCq0,316620,318840,and there was actually open discussion
pwA2rWWlCq0,318840,320639,maybe not all that serious but
pwA2rWWlCq0,320639,322860,discussion about Russia perhaps one day
pwA2rWWlCq0,322860,325320,joining the European Union in NATO
pwA2rWWlCq0,325320,327960,clearly it didn't go that way
pwA2rWWlCq0,327960,329639,and so what we've been dealing with now
pwA2rWWlCq0,329639,331860,is kind of a reversion to the norm
pwA2rWWlCq0,331860,334199,because the Russian ethnicity is the
pwA2rWWlCq0,334199,335699,only one that has ever actually
pwA2rWWlCq0,335699,337199,threatened the United States with
pwA2rWWlCq0,337199,339300,physical annihilation
pwA2rWWlCq0,339300,341280,it's difficult to see any way out of
pwA2rWWlCq0,341280,343979,this where we agree to try to get along
pwA2rWWlCq0,343979,345900,again especially now that the Putin
pwA2rWWlCq0,345900,347880,government has repeatedly brought up the
pwA2rWWlCq0,347880,349259,nuclear threat time and time and time
pwA2rWWlCq0,349259,350460,again it's like the one way to get the
pwA2rWWlCq0,350460,351840,Americans attention although I would
pwA2rWWlCq0,351840,353580,argue from the American point of view
pwA2rWWlCq0,353580,355500,America's attention is not what you're
pwA2rWWlCq0,355500,357780,after if you're trying to prosecute a
pwA2rWWlCq0,357780,359340,war in your corner of the world and not
pwA2rWWlCq0,359340,361259,invite American intervention if anything
pwA2rWWlCq0,361259,364199,it brings us to the table in a very bad
pwA2rWWlCq0,364199,365639,way from your point of view and we've
pwA2rWWlCq0,365639,367500,seen that time and time again
pwA2rWWlCq0,367500,371820,what's going on here is in many ways
pwA2rWWlCq0,371820,374340,a wonderful opportunity you know remove
pwA2rWWlCq0,374340,376800,the morals from the equation remove the
pwA2rWWlCq0,376800,378840,human suffering from the equation for a
pwA2rWWlCq0,378840,381000,moment the United States is being
pwA2rWWlCq0,381000,383520,presented with an opportunity to drive a
pwA2rWWlCq0,383520,387419,stake through the Russian heart forever
pwA2rWWlCq0,387419,389400,think about what the United States has
pwA2rWWlCq0,389400,391560,committed to this war to this point a
pwA2rWWlCq0,391560,394020,bunch of artillery a bunch of stingers a
pwA2rWWlCq0,394020,396180,bunch of javelins
pwA2rWWlCq0,396180,398699,these are not weapon systems that as a
pwA2rWWlCq0,398699,401759,rule the United States uses our
pwA2rWWlCq0,401759,404100,artillery systems are much longer range
pwA2rWWlCq0,404100,406380,none of those have been handed over we
pwA2rWWlCq0,406380,408419,don't use Stingers because we have an
pwA2rWWlCq0,408419,410819,Air Force we don't use a lot of javelins
pwA2rWWlCq0,410819,413759,because we have tanks the Weapons
pwA2rWWlCq0,413759,415199,Systems that the United States has
pwA2rWWlCq0,415199,418080,transferred to Ukraine are for the most
pwA2rWWlCq0,418080,420900,part Surplus and in many cases were
pwA2rWWlCq0,420900,423060,slotted for disposal so if anything the
pwA2rWWlCq0,423060,424620,ukrainians are doing as a budgetary
pwA2rWWlCq0,424620,426479,solid here by throwing them into the
pwA2rWWlCq0,426479,428819,teeth of the only country that has ever
pwA2rWWlCq0,428819,429780,threatened the United States with
pwA2rWWlCq0,429780,431340,annihilation
pwA2rWWlCq0,431340,435600,and if if the ukrainians can win this
pwA2rWWlCq0,435600,437759,it is difficult to see Russia in its
pwA2rWWlCq0,437759,439259,current forms surviving more than a
pwA2rWWlCq0,439259,442139,decade or two the Russian population is
pwA2rWWlCq0,442139,444360,dying out we don't have great data
pwA2rWWlCq0,444360,445800,because about a decade ago the Russians
pwA2rWWlCq0,445800,446880,just started lying about all their
pwA2rWWlCq0,446880,449580,demographic data but at that time we saw
pwA2rWWlCq0,449580,451800,a demographic collapse in progress that
pwA2rWWlCq0,451800,454080,was the worst in human history since
pwA2rWWlCq0,454080,455819,then they've been surpassed by the
pwA2rWWlCq0,455819,457800,Chinese but that's a topic for another
pwA2rWWlCq0,457800,458880,moment
pwA2rWWlCq0,458880,462060,if the old data is true we were already
pwA2rWWlCq0,462060,464280,looking at the Russian ethnicity losing
pwA2rWWlCq0,464280,466979,hold of the territories we now know as
pwA2rWWlCq0,466979,470639,Russia sometime between 2045 and 2070
pwA2rWWlCq0,470639,472800,probably and it's kind of iffy when you
pwA2rWWlCq0,472800,474180,get to demographics and that kind of
pwA2rWWlCq0,474180,476340,scale and there are other ethnicities
pwA2rWWlCq0,476340,478860,within the Russian space no notably the
pwA2rWWlCq0,478860,480960,tatars and the other turkic minorities
pwA2rWWlCq0,480960,483120,like the bashkiers or the chechens who
pwA2rWWlCq0,483120,484500,are actually experiencing robust
pwA2rWWlCq0,484500,485599,population
pwA2rWWlCq0,485599,488880,growth so people in the United States on
pwA2rWWlCq0,488880,490139,the right sometimes like to talk about
pwA2rWWlCq0,490139,492360,replacement theory in the case of the
pwA2rWWlCq0,492360,494400,Russian space it's not quite replacement
pwA2rWWlCq0,494400,496500,Theory it's just you have zones that are
pwA2rWWlCq0,496500,499319,having explosive population growth and
pwA2rWWlCq0,499319,500940,then zones that are having explosive
pwA2rWWlCq0,500940,502979,population collapse they don't overlap
pwA2rWWlCq0,502979,505139,they don't over mingle all that much but
pwA2rWWlCq0,505139,506400,it does mean that many of the
pwA2rWWlCq0,506400,508139,principalities that the Russians had
pwA2rWWlCq0,508139,510180,conquered in centuries past
pwA2rWWlCq0,510180,512219,are getting very close to the point
pwA2rWWlCq0,512219,514260,where they could chart out a different
pwA2rWWlCq0,514260,516479,demographic economic and strategic
pwA2rWWlCq0,516479,518159,future from Russia
pwA2rWWlCq0,518159,520500,and they're on the wrong side of natural
pwA2rWWlCq0,520500,522599,borders so you could have a robust
pwA2rWWlCq0,522599,525180,independent totter stand right next to a
pwA2rWWlCq0,525180,529200,dying Russian Empire and in that sort of
pwA2rWWlCq0,529200,531180,environment it is impossible for the
pwA2rWWlCq0,531180,533820,center to hold and all the United States
pwA2rWWlCq0,533820,536519,has to do to make this work is help the
