w93XoP5g95o,0,2040,hey everybody Peter zein here coming to
w93XoP5g95o,2040,5100,you from Colorado uh the news of this
w93XoP5g95o,5100,7560,week is this oil export ban that the
w93XoP5g95o,7560,10800,Europeans are putting in place the idea
w93XoP5g95o,10800,13920,is that Russia will still be able to
w93XoP5g95o,13920,15740,export their crew to International
w93XoP5g95o,15740,19320,markets but there is now a price cap in
w93XoP5g95o,19320,22020,what they can ask it's currently it's
w93XoP5g95o,22020,23820,set at 60 although they will change that
w93XoP5g95o,23820,25439,over time based on what happens what
w93XoP5g95o,25439,27080,happens with International Energy prices
w93XoP5g95o,27080,29880,the enforcement mechanism is that the
w93XoP5g95o,29880,32040,Europeans dominate global insurance and
w93XoP5g95o,32040,34739,Global Maritime services and that any
w93XoP5g95o,34739,36899,vessel that is carrying crude that is
w93XoP5g95o,36899,38820,above that sixty dollars that was the
w93XoP5g95o,38820,41399,sale Point won't be able to access any
w93XoP5g95o,41399,43620,European Financial or physical services
w93XoP5g95o,43620,45840,so that's Port access that's insurance
w93XoP5g95o,45840,47760,policies and without a maritime
w93XoP5g95o,47760,50340,insurance policy Your Vessel could not
w93XoP5g95o,50340,52440,interport exit port or leave a
w93XoP5g95o,52440,54120,constrained Waterway say like the Suez
w93XoP5g95o,54120,56399,Canal or the Turkish Straits
w93XoP5g95o,56399,60000,now this is this is unprecedented in any
w93XoP5g95o,60000,61199,number of ways and so I really don't
w93XoP5g95o,61199,63539,know how it's going to play out so the
w93XoP5g95o,63539,65640,purpose of this video is less to give
w93XoP5g95o,65640,67619,you a firm forecast but to give you an
w93XoP5g95o,67619,69840,idea of kind of the Matrix of factors
w93XoP5g95o,69840,72600,and what matters so that you can kind of
w93XoP5g95o,72600,74100,draw your own conclusions and have some
w93XoP5g95o,74100,76860,idea of what to look for the first and
w93XoP5g95o,76860,78240,most important thing to keep in mind is
w93XoP5g95o,78240,81000,that not all crude oil is made equal
w93XoP5g95o,81000,84000,crude oil is not fungible you can't take
w93XoP5g95o,84000,86340,crude from a Texas field and put it into
w93XoP5g95o,86340,87960,Refinery that was designed for crude
w93XoP5g95o,87960,89400,from a Saudi Arabian field and vice
w93XoP5g95o,89400,91860,versa and even within Russia we have
w93XoP5g95o,91860,94140,multiple crude grades the first one the
w93XoP5g95o,94140,95220,one that matters the most is called
w93XoP5g95o,95220,96439,Euros crude
w93XoP5g95o,96439,100200,u-r-a-l-s uh it is basically everything
w93XoP5g95o,100200,102600,that comes from the Northern or Western
w93XoP5g95o,102600,105000,Siberian projects as well as a lot of
w93XoP5g95o,105000,106200,stuff that comes from Southern Russia
w93XoP5g95o,106200,107640,it's all put into the same network and
w93XoP5g95o,107640,111119,sent West to export points via pipe that
w93XoP5g95o,111119,112500,go through Ukraine or Belarus to Europe
w93XoP5g95o,112500,115860,or to ports on the Black Sea or the
w93XoP5g95o,115860,118500,Baltic Sea and collectively you're
w93XoP5g95o,118500,120840,talking here about about five maybe five
w93XoP5g95o,120840,122280,and a half million barrels a day in
w93XoP5g95o,122280,124500,every given moment of which about half
w93XoP5g95o,124500,126899,of which is exported
w93XoP5g95o,126899,132060,now if if if this cap goes wrong and the
w93XoP5g95o,132060,134220,Russians decide that they're not going
w93XoP5g95o,134220,136319,to produce at a price that they cannot
w93XoP5g95o,136319,139440,influence much less control then what
w93XoP5g95o,139440,141000,would happen is pressure would build up
w93XoP5g95o,141000,142620,in the pipes all the way back up to the
w93XoP5g95o,142620,144180,wellheads and since this is in
w93XoP5g95o,144180,146819,permafrost when the oil stops flowing in
w93XoP5g95o,146819,149340,permafrost it turns to gel becomes a
w93XoP5g95o,149340,151379,plug in the pipeline and the water that
w93XoP5g95o,151379,153300,comes up as a byproduct freezes into ice
w93XoP5g95o,153300,154860,and when water freezes it cracks the
w93XoP5g95o,154860,156300,pipe from the inside and it takes years
w93XoP5g95o,156300,158940,if not decades to repair that sort of
w93XoP5g95o,158940,161040,system the last time this happened at
w93XoP5g95o,161040,161940,scale
w93XoP5g95o,161940,164340,it was 1992
w93XoP5g95o,164340,167640,and in 1992 everything went offline they
w93XoP5g95o,167640,169319,took the Russians 30 years to repair the
w93XoP5g95o,169319,171360,damage only most of the repair work was
w93XoP5g95o,171360,174060,not done by the Russians it was done by
w93XoP5g95o,174060,176040,oil services firms and they are no
w93XoP5g95o,176040,177780,longer operating in Russia for the most
w93XoP5g95o,177780,178800,part
w93XoP5g95o,178800,180660,now will this happen again that is the
w93XoP5g95o,180660,182879,open question this is a prediction that
w93XoP5g95o,182879,185280,I made back in I want to say April when
w93XoP5g95o,185280,186720,the world was just going on it looked
w93XoP5g95o,186720,187739,like we were going to get to see
w93XoP5g95o,187739,190200,significant shut-ins and we did to the
w93XoP5g95o,190200,192319,tune of about a million barrels a day
w93XoP5g95o,192319,195900,but not all of the inputs that go into
w93XoP5g95o,195900,199319,Euros crude come from Western Siberia in
w93XoP5g95o,199319,201480,the permafrost there's about a million
w93XoP5g95o,201480,203400,maybe a million and a half barrels a day
w93XoP5g95o,203400,205319,that come from more temperate locations
w93XoP5g95o,205319,208019,like todderstone and bashkuristan and so
w93XoP5g95o,208019,210599,when the demand profile dropped off and
w93XoP5g95o,210599,211680,the Russians were left with that
w93XoP5g95o,211680,212940,pressure in the pipes and was building
w93XoP5g95o,212940,215640,up to the wellheads they chose to shut
w93XoP5g95o,215640,217140,off the wells and taters down in
w93XoP5g95o,217140,219180,bashkarastan because they knew that they
w93XoP5g95o,219180,220739,could start those up later they knew
w93XoP5g95o,220739,222420,they wouldn't have the freezing issue
w93XoP5g95o,222420,224159,and that allowed the Russians to get
w93XoP5g95o,224159,225299,around it
w93XoP5g95o,225299,227760,this time around with the export ban or
w93XoP5g95o,227760,229500,the fact that the insurance ban expands
w93XoP5g95o,229500,231180,in January to be a lot more cohesive
w93XoP5g95o,231180,233159,it's an open question of what will
w93XoP5g95o,233159,234540,happen first and what will happen
w93XoP5g95o,234540,237060,fastest and we're going to see if the
w93XoP5g95o,237060,240840,price cap has an impact uh the second
w93XoP5g95o,240840,242580,thing that's happened with Euros is that
w93XoP5g95o,242580,245340,the Turks who are one of the world's
w93XoP5g95o,245340,247860,larger importers of Euro Crews have
w93XoP5g95o,247860,252060,decided to abide by the price cap and
w93XoP5g95o,252060,253680,since they controlled the Turkish
w93XoP5g95o,253680,255060,streets the Bosphorus and the Dardanelle
w93XoP5g95o,255060,256680,so it allows about one and a half
w93XoP5g95o,256680,258180,million barrels a day of Earls to reach
w93XoP5g95o,258180,260340,the wider world that's a really big deal
w93XoP5g95o,260340,263040,now the Turks are doing this not
w93XoP5g95o,263040,264660,necessarily because they've taken a hard
w93XoP5g95o,264660,266580,line in all things Ukraine war but they
w93XoP5g95o,266580,268259,see an excellent opportunity here
w93XoP5g95o,268259,270840,they're one of the few countries that
w93XoP5g95o,270840,272759,has any sort of
w93XoP5g95o,272759,274919,position in the Russian system the
w93XoP5g95o,274919,276479,Russians will still talk to the Turks
w93XoP5g95o,276479,279300,and so they're making the most of it
w93XoP5g95o,279300,282419,they import about 300 350
w93XoP5g95o,282419,284100,000 barrels a day and if they can get a
w93XoP5g95o,284100,287280,permanent discount on all of that
w93XoP5g95o,287280,289979,they're like sweet and they're perfectly
w93XoP5g95o,289979,293160,willing to cooperate uh the other chunks
w93XoP5g95o,293160,295620,of Euros crew that are seaborne go out
w93XoP5g95o,295620,297419,from the Baltic Sea and that's where I
w93XoP5g95o,297419,299160,would expect a security issue to be a
w93XoP5g95o,299160,300720,bigger concern because you're then
w93XoP5g95o,300720,302280,Sailing by a number of countries that
w93XoP5g95o,302280,304320,are pathologically hostile to All Things
w93XoP5g95o,304320,306960,Russian Estonia Lafayette Lithuania
w93XoP5g95o,306960,311460,Sweden Finland Norway Denmark Poland I
w93XoP5g95o,311460,313320,can easily see some of them kind of
w93XoP5g95o,313320,314940,sticking their Coast Guard out there and
w93XoP5g95o,314940,316860,grabbing a ship or two to inspect to
w93XoP5g95o,316860,318000,make sure that they're following the
w93XoP5g95o,318000,318780,rules
w93XoP5g95o,318780,320460,and if they find out that they're not
w93XoP5g95o,320460,321900,then all of a sudden the insurance comes
w93XoP5g95o,321900,323699,into question and ships won't want to go
w93XoP5g95o,323699,327479,in to uh the port of primorsk on the
w93XoP5g95o,327479,328800,Russian Coast where the discouragement
w93XoP5g95o,328800,330840,part point is and that's how we would
w93XoP5g95o,330840,332460,get roughly another million and a half
w93XoP5g95o,332460,334380,that it would be back up now that by
w93XoP5g95o,334380,337560,itself is the absolute maximum that
w93XoP5g95o,337560,338940,could be disrupted without actually
w93XoP5g95o,338940,341639,hurting the broad scale of what goes on
w93XoP5g95o,341639,344280,in Siberia it would need more than this
w93XoP5g95o,344280,345539,but I think that's where we're most
w93XoP5g95o,345539,347400,likely to see the disruption in terms of
w93XoP5g95o,347400,350280,security concerns okay that's all urls
w93XoP5g95o,350280,352500,there's one other crude blend that the
w93XoP5g95o,352500,354780,Russians have it's called espo the
w93XoP5g95o,354780,356940,Eastern Siberian Pacific pipeline
w93XoP5g95o,356940,360000,and it takes crude from Eastern Siberia
w93XoP5g95o,360000,361979,and sends it through a very very long
w93XoP5g95o,361979,365580,pipe route to get to nakodka which is
w93XoP5g95o,365580,368639,their port near Vladivostok on the east
w93XoP5g95o,368639,370740,coast of the Eurasian land mass going to
w93XoP5g95o,370740,373380,the Pacific Ocean now most of this crude
w93XoP5g95o,373380,377759,goes to Japan Korea China and India much
w93XoP5g95o,377759,380520,closer physically to the Eastern markets
w93XoP5g95o,380520,383180,than the Euros discouragement points are
w93XoP5g95o,383180,385860,also because the Europeans are not
w93XoP5g95o,385860,387300,involved on that side of the continent
w93XoP5g95o,387300,390000,we don't see the same split in pricing
w93XoP5g95o,390000,392100,so Euros is already selling at somewhere
w93XoP5g95o,392100,394380,between 20 and 35 dollars a discount and
w93XoP5g95o,394380,396180,so it's very close to the 60 price cap
w93XoP5g95o,396180,399780,that the new regulations require once
w93XoP5g95o,399780,402300,you get to the East Coast it's more a no
w93XoP5g95o,402300,404280,one wants to feed a little dirty and so
w93XoP5g95o,404280,406259,the price discount is only between five
w93XoP5g95o,406259,409080,and fifteen dollars this is where we're
w93XoP5g95o,409080,410580,going to find out
w93XoP5g95o,410580,412979,whether or not the insurance policy
w93XoP5g95o,412979,415080,shift and the price cap shift actually
w93XoP5g95o,415080,418380,has a real long-term impact
w93XoP5g95o,418380,421199,because these are areas that if there
w93XoP5g95o,421199,423419,ever was a national interest in building
w93XoP5g95o,423419,426780,a domestic Insurance system to get
w93XoP5g95o,426780,428400,around what the Europeans are doing this
w93XoP5g95o,428400,429720,is where would you try it because the
w93XoP5g95o,429720,430860,Europeans are on the other side of the
w93XoP5g95o,430860,431819,continent there's been a lot of
w93XoP5g95o,431819,432900,resentment that the Europeans have
w93XoP5g95o,432900,435120,controlled this financial space for so
w93XoP5g95o,435120,437580,long anyway and I can see the Chinese in
w93XoP5g95o,437580,440460,particular having a reason to try to
w93XoP5g95o,440460,443099,offer their own insurance policies in
w93XoP5g95o,443099,444900,order to just get away from that system
w93XoP5g95o,444900,446940,of the price Gap altogether here's the
w93XoP5g95o,446940,447720,problem
w93XoP5g95o,447720,450660,the Chinese are terrified of secondary
w93XoP5g95o,450660,453419,effects they realize they have no
w93XoP5g95o,453419,455160,friends left in Washington they realize
w93XoP5g95o,455160,456720,they have very few friends left in
w93XoP5g95o,456720,458880,Brussels they realize that their
w93XoP5g95o,458880,461340,economic system is in trouble and they
w93XoP5g95o,461340,463740,realize that their own demography is so
w93XoP5g95o,463740,465960,atrocious that they are incapable of
w93XoP5g95o,465960,467940,making any sort of transition to a
w93XoP5g95o,467940,470520,consumption-led system so they like the
w93XoP5g95o,470520,472440,idea of the Russians not being destroyed
w93XoP5g95o,472440,474360,in this war and they really like the
w93XoP5g95o,474360,476340,idea of not having to lash themselves to
w93XoP5g95o,476340,478500,the Russians and offering a National
w93XoP5g95o,478500,481380,Insurance indemnification system for the
w93XoP5g95o,481380,483720,sole purpose of getting around a
w93XoP5g95o,483720,486120,European sanctions regime that is likely
w93XoP5g95o,486120,487560,to be perceived in Europe as a
w93XoP5g95o,487560,489960,relatively hostile Act and they don't
w93XoP5g95o,489960,491940,know what the Europeans will do next
w93XoP5g95o,491940,494400,much less if the Americans get involved
w93XoP5g95o,494400,497699,so I actually see this being instead of
w93XoP5g95o,497699,499379,a broad scale system that the Chinese
w93XoP5g95o,499379,502139,punch into each individual country
w93XoP5g95o,502139,503940,having to make the decision for their
w93XoP5g95o,503940,505620,own oil imports where they want to do it
w93XoP5g95o,505620,508139,for themselves so Chinese insurance for
w93XoP5g95o,508139,509699,Chinese shipments Indian insurance for
w93XoP5g95o,509699,512940,Indian shipments it kind of diffuses the
w93XoP5g95o,512940,514800,anger that might boil up out of the
w93XoP5g95o,514800,516779,European capitals
w93XoP5g95o,516779,518700,and makes it less likely it will be a
w93XoP5g95o,518700,520860,harsh response now that might not be
w93XoP5g95o,520860,522659,great for the price cap but it also
w93XoP5g95o,522659,524459,means the Chinese are going out of their
w93XoP5g95o,524459,528660,way to abide at least in part by the
w93XoP5g95o,528660,531120,sanctions regime moving forward
w93XoP5g95o,531120,534480,now that's a lot of minutia if you're
w93XoP5g95o,534480,537779,looking for a single big takeaway here
w93XoP5g95o,537779,540839,it is we've had more or less a single
w93XoP5g95o,540839,544380,Global price for oil since 1945. the
w93XoP5g95o,544380,546660,Americans have provided Freedom of the
w93XoP5g95o,546660,549000,Seas and we've had a single currency
w93XoP5g95o,549000,550740,model in order to undergrade all the
w93XoP5g95o,550740,552959,financial sides of things
w93XoP5g95o,552959,555420,that's going away we now have two
w93XoP5g95o,555420,557040,different price points just for Russian
w93XoP5g95o,557040,559680,crude without a security incident on the
w93XoP5g95o,559680,561240,high seats which is almost certainly
w93XoP5g95o,561240,563820,coming in the Baltic Sea and we now have
w93XoP5g95o,563820,565019,multiple countries that are getting
w93XoP5g95o,565019,568620,involved establishing sequestered lines
w93XoP5g95o,568620,570300,of Supply from specific countries to
w93XoP5g95o,570300,571740,specific countries
w93XoP5g95o,571740,575279,you break things up like that and there
w93XoP5g95o,575279,577560,is no longer an interest for any of the
w93XoP5g95o,577560,579720,countries that have a large Navy for
w93XoP5g95o,579720,582000,keeping Global shipments safe for this
w93XoP5g95o,582000,584459,stuff on a global scale they will be
w93XoP5g95o,584459,588300,increasingly curious and interested in
w93XoP5g95o,588300,590760,only the cargos go from places of
w93XoP5g95o,590760,593339,interest to themselves and in that sort
w93XoP5g95o,593339,596120,of environment
w93XoP5g95o,596660,599640,the temptation to mess with someone
w93XoP5g95o,599640,602820,else's supply lines are incredibly High
w93XoP5g95o,602820,606000,we are very rapidly in energy terms
w93XoP5g95o,606000,609660,getting back to the world of the 1930s
w93XoP5g95o,609660,612180,and for those of you who know your 1930s
w93XoP5g95o,612180,614459,strategy and economic patterns I think
w93XoP5g95o,614459,616080,you can identify exactly where that
w93XoP5g95o,616080,617880,leads
w93XoP5g95o,617880,620820,fun okay that's it from me until next
w93XoP5g95o,620820,623000,time
