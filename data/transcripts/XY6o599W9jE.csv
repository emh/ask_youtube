XY6o599W9jE,0,2220,hey everybody Peter zein here coming to
XY6o599W9jE,2220,4500,you from San Diego today I wanted to
XY6o599W9jE,4500,6839,talk about the rail dispute that is
XY6o599W9jE,6839,8880,about to generate a strike in the United
XY6o599W9jE,8880,12059,States uh rail in the United States is
XY6o599W9jE,12059,14460,used for any sort of large type of bulk
XY6o599W9jE,14460,16680,transport whether it's fuel or food or
XY6o599W9jE,16680,18000,containers that have been moved from the
XY6o599W9jE,18000,20220,ports specifically in things that are
XY6o599W9jE,20220,22439,transferred from either the Pacific
XY6o599W9jE,22439,24720,coast inward for ant consumption or
XY6o599W9jE,24720,26100,things like fertilizer that come from
XY6o599W9jE,26100,28560,the Gulf Coast up to the Midwest
XY6o599W9jE,28560,29939,it's an important part of the system
XY6o599W9jE,29939,32220,it's the second largest transport
XY6o599W9jE,32220,34020,capacity the United States has in terms
XY6o599W9jE,34020,37200,of ton miles and it matters for two
XY6o599W9jE,37200,39719,reasons first my perennial one-man war
XY6o599W9jE,39719,42120,against the Jones act we used to ship a
XY6o599W9jE,42120,43860,lot of things via water but with the
XY6o599W9jE,43860,46260,Jones act we now can only ship items
XY6o599W9jE,46260,47760,between two American ports that are
XY6o599W9jE,47760,49079,America on vessels that are American
XY6o599W9jE,49079,52200,owned operated captained and crude and
XY6o599W9jE,52200,54239,that has led us to reduce the use of the
XY6o599W9jE,54239,57800,waterways by in excess of 99 almost
XY6o599W9jE,57800,60300,condemning uh our Maritime transport
XY6o599W9jE,60300,61680,system which is the best natural Network
XY6o599W9jE,61680,63059,in the world to
XY6o599W9jE,63059,65939,irrelevance as long as that is the case
XY6o599W9jE,65939,67740,rail is the only way they can move
XY6o599W9jE,67740,70500,things in size and if we had something
XY6o599W9jE,70500,72299,like the Jones act for rail the rail
XY6o599W9jE,72299,73500,system would shut down if we had
XY6o599W9jE,73500,75119,something like the Jones act for
XY6o599W9jE,75119,77040,transport no more Toyota no more
XY6o599W9jE,77040,79920,Mercedes or BMW or Fujitsu or any of the
XY6o599W9jE,79920,81060,others so it gives you an idea of how
XY6o599W9jE,81060,82799,distortionary it is
XY6o599W9jE,82799,86580,second it's political if we were under a
XY6o599W9jE,86580,89100,different time frame say Obama earlier
XY6o599W9jE,89100,90780,we would have had a very different
XY6o599W9jE,90780,92759,resolution here because we probably
XY6o599W9jE,92759,94259,would have had some strike Busters
XY6o599W9jE,94259,95579,already been ordered in by the federal
XY6o599W9jE,95579,97680,government because the rail system is so
XY6o599W9jE,97680,99299,critical to the American economic
XY6o599W9jE,99299,100979,functioning
XY6o599W9jE,100979,103439,however we're not going to see that if
XY6o599W9jE,103439,105060,anything we're going to see this
XY6o599W9jE,105060,107520,Administration citing with the unions
XY6o599W9jE,107520,109920,and the reason is is that we are an
XY6o599W9jE,109920,112259,attorney of the political system now
XY6o599W9jE,112259,115560,every generation or two the factions
XY6o599W9jE,115560,117720,that make up the political parties in
XY6o599W9jE,117720,120240,the United States move around and in
XY6o599W9jE,120240,121680,many ways this is not a bug it's a
XY6o599W9jE,121680,123840,feature of the system we have a
XY6o599W9jE,123840,125520,two-party system because that's what our
XY6o599W9jE,125520,127680,constitution more or less requires and
XY6o599W9jE,127680,130080,dictates we have a first past the post
XY6o599W9jE,130080,132060,single member district system which is a
XY6o599W9jE,132060,133560,fancy way of saying that when you go to
XY6o599W9jE,133560,136500,vote you vote for a specific person who
XY6o599W9jE,136500,138780,will represent a specific geography
XY6o599W9jE,138780,141480,you're not voting for a party or voting
XY6o599W9jE,141480,143700,for an individual and that makes
XY6o599W9jE,143700,145739,American political parties relatively
XY6o599W9jE,145739,147360,weak compared to say how they are in
XY6o599W9jE,147360,148739,Europe or Asia
XY6o599W9jE,148739,151319,and that means that we get factions of
XY6o599W9jE,151319,154040,these Independent party candidates
XY6o599W9jE,154040,157140,within the umbrella of the big tents of
XY6o599W9jE,157140,159480,the Democrats and the Republicans and as
XY6o599W9jE,159480,162300,technology evolves as the economy shifts
XY6o599W9jE,162300,165360,as demography changes those factions
XY6o599W9jE,165360,168840,rise and fall in power and sometimes
XY6o599W9jE,168840,171900,once a generation or two the factions
XY6o599W9jE,171900,175019,lose power or gain power to a scale that
XY6o599W9jE,175019,177239,disrupts the entire system this has
XY6o599W9jE,177239,180900,happened to us six times before the last
XY6o599W9jE,180900,183720,big time it shifted in the 1930s all the
XY6o599W9jE,183720,185940,African Americans were Republicans and
XY6o599W9jE,185940,187620,all of big business were Democrats and
XY6o599W9jE,187620,189000,obviously that's not the world we're in
XY6o599W9jE,189000,190080,today
XY6o599W9jE,190080,193140,well in the last 30 years we've had the
XY6o599W9jE,193140,194879,rise of alter globalization and now it's
XY6o599W9jE,194879,196739,collapsed the rise of China and now it's
XY6o599W9jE,196739,198200,collapsed the rise of Information
XY6o599W9jE,198200,201599,Technology uh the the Green Revolution
XY6o599W9jE,201599,203159,all of these things have happened in a
XY6o599W9jE,203159,204239,relatively short period of time
XY6o599W9jE,204239,206040,coinciding with the collapse of the
XY6o599W9jE,206040,207360,Soviet Union and now the return of the
XY6o599W9jE,207360,209159,Russians of course we're going to manage
XY6o599W9jE,209159,211140,our political system differently and so
XY6o599W9jE,211140,212819,the factions are once again in motion
XY6o599W9jE,212819,215459,and the faction that is currently in the
XY6o599W9jE,215459,216900,middle of a tug of war between the
XY6o599W9jE,216900,218819,Democrats and the Republicans is
XY6o599W9jE,218819,222900,organized labor so any issue that the
XY6o599W9jE,222900,226140,unions don't like is not something that
XY6o599W9jE,226140,228299,anyone is going to raise at the national
XY6o599W9jE,228299,230819,level because they feel they need that
XY6o599W9jE,230819,233220,faction that's a lot of votes
XY6o599W9jE,233220,235620,and so whether it's Union issues with
XY6o599W9jE,235620,237120,the Jones Act
XY6o599W9jE,237120,238620,whether it's Union issues with Rail
XY6o599W9jE,238620,241200,Yards and whether it's issues of
XY6o599W9jE,241200,242819,immigration the unions are against
XY6o599W9jE,242819,246540,changes in those systems and so they are
XY6o599W9jE,246540,248700,going to resist and as long as that is
XY6o599W9jE,248700,250560,going on we are not going to see a
XY6o599W9jE,250560,251700,resolution
XY6o599W9jE,251700,254519,so with the Rail Yards I do expect the
XY6o599W9jE,254519,256260,federal government to get involved but
XY6o599W9jE,256260,258299,on the side of the unions and that has
XY6o599W9jE,258299,259919,nothing to do with the fact that Biden
XY6o599W9jE,259919,261720,has generally been pro-union it's just
XY6o599W9jE,261720,263340,because that's where the politics are
XY6o599W9jE,263340,264780,falling to both sides if anything we're
XY6o599W9jE,264780,266280,actually seeing the Republican party
XY6o599W9jE,266280,269460,right now arguing for the unions which
XY6o599W9jE,269460,270840,is a weird place to be in but again
XY6o599W9jE,270840,273360,everything is in motion all right that
XY6o599W9jE,273360,275280,hopefully explains it that's it whoa
XY6o599W9jE,275280,279320,seagull that's it for me until next time
