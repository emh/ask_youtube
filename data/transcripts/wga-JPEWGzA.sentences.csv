wga-JPEWGzA,0,"Hey everyone Peter Zion, here coming toyou from Colorado"
wga-JPEWGzA,1,"I wanted to talk todayabout, something that went down on the4th of December uh"
wga-JPEWGzA,2,"The ukrainians, usedsome long-range drones in order tostrike a military Airfield, deep, insideof Russia, something that was severalhundred kilometers from the borderthis, is one of those things that if thewar had gone on long enough was alwaysgoing to come into play"
wga-JPEWGzA,3,"One of the bigmisconceptions in The Wider world and inRussia specifically, is that all theintelligency of the old Soviet systemwere Russian and therefore everyone elsewas just a subject"
wga-JPEWGzA,4,Peoplesthere were a lot of things about theSoviet system that were a hot mess
wga-JPEWGzA,5,"Butone of the big social advances they gotwas actually relatively minimizing thedifferences ethnic in terms of ethnicityof, who is a real person who can gettraining and who can contribute tosociety"
wga-JPEWGzA,6,"So, for example, the guy whodesigned Mir was an ethnic totter and inthe case of Aerospace"
wga-JPEWGzA,7,There was a heavyconcentration of that industry withinUkraine as opposed to within Russiaand in post-soviet Ukraine
wga-JPEWGzA,8,Aerospacedesign has continued now it might notmeet American or Western specificationsbut
wga-JPEWGzA,9,"That'S as much about protectionismas about skill, set differences and sothere's never been this belief"
wga-JPEWGzA,10,"Anywherethat, the ukrainians didn't know, whatthey were doing when it comes toAerospace, so assuming that it could holdout long enough and assuming they couldScrabble to get other resources"
wga-JPEWGzA,11,"There isnever a doubt that a country that founditself in a position where it neededdrones and had to buy them, wouldn't beable to make their own well now, theyhavehere"
wga-JPEWGzA,12,"We are roughly 10 months into thewar, and the ukrainians have put togethera long-range drone that has a range ofaccording to them about a thousand milesthey will neverbe able to put enough of them up"
wga-JPEWGzA,13,Tooverall change the overall tenor of thewar
wga-JPEWGzA,14,"The the Russian military has massiveassets throughout the Western space theWestern Russian space, whether it'srecruiting stations or air bases, ormissile silos and any weapon that isgoing to be able to go"
wga-JPEWGzA,15,That far is notgoing to be able to carry much of apayloadbut initials indicators suggest that thepayload was in excess of 150
wga-JPEWGzA,16,Poundswhich is pretty good for a drone and ifthe ukrainians can throw enough of themthey can do some very real damage
wga-JPEWGzA,17,"Now weonly have one days of data to work offof, but right now the ukrainians, arefocused on on the military assetsthat, are launching bomber attacks, onUkrainian civilian infrastructure, sokind of one of those uh that flies bothwaysbut"
wga-JPEWGzA,18,We need to start thinking about whatit means
wga-JPEWGzA,19,Should the ukrainians throw awider net and striking much longer termbecause their goal here isn't simply todegrade
wga-JPEWGzA,20,"Russia'S military capacity theirgoal is to degrade Russia's militarycapacity enough so that the Russianshave to give in the Russians have neverbacked down from a war without losing atleast a half a million men first andwe're, probably between 80 and 90 000right"
wga-JPEWGzA,21,"Now so we have a long way to goand if Ukraine can degrade Russia'seconomic capacities to fight the warthat's, how you prevent the Russians inthe mid to long run from rearming in away that they can throw weapons intoUkrainian urban areaseasiest way to do that, isn't to go"
wga-JPEWGzA,22,"Afterapartment blocks or even power stationsbut to Target refineries and the Nexuspoints, where lots of Russian pipelinescome together to a single facility forredistributionthere, are a number of refineriesthroughout"
wga-JPEWGzA,23,"The Russian space we've got amap attached to show you the biggestones, but the one facility that I want todraw the most attention to is the cityof SamaraSamara is a pipeline Nexus and refiningCenter for pretty much all of theRussian stuff that comes in from SouthCentral Siberia, as well As intodderstone and bashqiristan and a lotof the oil projects that the Russianshave that are not subject to some of theconstraints that they have in thepermafrost, if you shut down an oil fieldin, the permafrost, you probably neverstart it up again, because the pipesfreeze from the inside but further Southin bashqiristan and tartarstan that's adifferent picture"
wga-JPEWGzA,24,It'S not permafrost
wga-JPEWGzA,25,Sothe Russians can turn those on and offbut
wga-JPEWGzA,26,"If you remove Samara from theequation, then Russia's ability to beflexible in anything that relates toenergy, including domestic suppliessuddenly, goes away"
wga-JPEWGzA,27,"That'S the soft pointin, the Russian system and the ukrainiansknow itokay"
wga-JPEWGzA,28,That'S it for me until next time
wga-JPEWGzA,29,""
