wga-JPEWGzA,0,2280,hey everyone Peter Zion here coming to
wga-JPEWGzA,2280,4440,you from Colorado I wanted to talk today
wga-JPEWGzA,4440,6420,about something that went down on the
wga-JPEWGzA,6420,9720,4th of December uh the ukrainians used
wga-JPEWGzA,9720,12059,some long-range drones in order to
wga-JPEWGzA,12059,14700,strike a military Airfield deep inside
wga-JPEWGzA,14700,17100,of Russia something that was several
wga-JPEWGzA,17100,19619,hundred kilometers from the border
wga-JPEWGzA,19619,22680,this is one of those things that if the
wga-JPEWGzA,22680,24660,war had gone on long enough was always
wga-JPEWGzA,24660,27539,going to come into play one of the big
wga-JPEWGzA,27539,29880,misconceptions in The Wider world and in
wga-JPEWGzA,29880,31920,Russia specifically is that all the
wga-JPEWGzA,31920,33780,intelligency of the old Soviet system
wga-JPEWGzA,33780,35579,were Russian and therefore everyone else
wga-JPEWGzA,35579,37380,was just a subject peoples
wga-JPEWGzA,37380,38640,there were a lot of things about the
wga-JPEWGzA,38640,41219,Soviet system that were a hot mess but
wga-JPEWGzA,41219,43079,one of the big social advances they got
wga-JPEWGzA,43079,45660,was actually relatively minimizing the
wga-JPEWGzA,45660,47820,differences ethnic in terms of ethnicity
wga-JPEWGzA,47820,49920,of who is a real person who can get
wga-JPEWGzA,49920,51960,training and who can contribute to
wga-JPEWGzA,51960,55320,society so for example the guy who
wga-JPEWGzA,55320,58920,designed Mir was an ethnic totter and in
wga-JPEWGzA,58920,61079,the case of Aerospace there was a heavy
wga-JPEWGzA,61079,63239,concentration of that industry within
wga-JPEWGzA,63239,65700,Ukraine as opposed to within Russia
wga-JPEWGzA,65700,68580,and in post-soviet Ukraine Aerospace
wga-JPEWGzA,68580,70860,design has continued now it might not
wga-JPEWGzA,70860,73380,meet American or Western specifications
wga-JPEWGzA,73380,75060,but that's as much about protectionism
wga-JPEWGzA,75060,77820,as about skill set differences and so
wga-JPEWGzA,77820,80580,there's never been this belief anywhere
wga-JPEWGzA,80580,81840,that the ukrainians didn't know what
wga-JPEWGzA,81840,82680,they were doing when it comes to
wga-JPEWGzA,82680,84720,Aerospace so assuming that it could hold
wga-JPEWGzA,84720,86220,out long enough and assuming they could
wga-JPEWGzA,86220,88799,Scrabble to get other resources there is
wga-JPEWGzA,88799,90479,never a doubt that a country that found
wga-JPEWGzA,90479,92340,itself in a position where it needed
wga-JPEWGzA,92340,94680,drones and had to buy them wouldn't be
wga-JPEWGzA,94680,96900,able to make their own well now they
wga-JPEWGzA,96900,97740,have
wga-JPEWGzA,97740,100320,here we are roughly 10 months into the
wga-JPEWGzA,100320,102299,war and the ukrainians have put together
wga-JPEWGzA,102299,104640,a long-range drone that has a range of
wga-JPEWGzA,104640,108920,according to them about a thousand miles
wga-JPEWGzA,109560,111360,they will never
wga-JPEWGzA,111360,114299,be able to put enough of them up to
wga-JPEWGzA,114299,116700,overall change the overall tenor of the
wga-JPEWGzA,116700,119460,war the the Russian military has massive
wga-JPEWGzA,119460,121380,assets throughout the Western space the
wga-JPEWGzA,121380,123540,Western Russian space whether it's
wga-JPEWGzA,123540,125399,recruiting stations or air bases or
wga-JPEWGzA,125399,128340,missile silos and any weapon that is
wga-JPEWGzA,128340,130800,going to be able to go that far is not
wga-JPEWGzA,130800,132120,going to be able to carry much of a
wga-JPEWGzA,132120,133440,payload
wga-JPEWGzA,133440,137400,but initials indicators suggest that the
wga-JPEWGzA,137400,140040,payload was in excess of 150 pounds
wga-JPEWGzA,140040,142800,which is pretty good for a drone and if
wga-JPEWGzA,142800,144180,the ukrainians can throw enough of them
wga-JPEWGzA,144180,146819,they can do some very real damage now we
wga-JPEWGzA,146819,149099,only have one days of data to work off
wga-JPEWGzA,149099,150660,of but right now the ukrainians are
wga-JPEWGzA,150660,153000,focused on on the military assets
wga-JPEWGzA,153000,155280,that are launching bomber attacks on
wga-JPEWGzA,155280,156900,Ukrainian civilian infrastructure so
wga-JPEWGzA,156900,159720,kind of one of those uh that flies both
wga-JPEWGzA,159720,160620,ways
wga-JPEWGzA,160620,162780,but we need to start thinking about what
wga-JPEWGzA,162780,165599,it means should the ukrainians throw a
wga-JPEWGzA,165599,168780,wider net and striking much longer term
wga-JPEWGzA,168780,171060,because their goal here isn't simply to
wga-JPEWGzA,171060,172980,degrade Russia's military capacity their
wga-JPEWGzA,172980,174480,goal is to degrade Russia's military
wga-JPEWGzA,174480,176940,capacity enough so that the Russians
wga-JPEWGzA,176940,179280,have to give in the Russians have never
wga-JPEWGzA,179280,181140,backed down from a war without losing at
wga-JPEWGzA,181140,183300,least a half a million men first and
wga-JPEWGzA,183300,185340,we're probably between 80 and 90 000
wga-JPEWGzA,185340,187800,right now so we have a long way to go
wga-JPEWGzA,187800,191040,and if Ukraine can degrade Russia's
wga-JPEWGzA,191040,193680,economic capacities to fight the war
wga-JPEWGzA,193680,195959,that's how you prevent the Russians in
wga-JPEWGzA,195959,198060,the mid to long run from rearming in a
wga-JPEWGzA,198060,199680,way that they can throw weapons into
wga-JPEWGzA,199680,201840,Ukrainian urban areas
wga-JPEWGzA,201840,204900,easiest way to do that isn't to go after
wga-JPEWGzA,204900,207360,apartment blocks or even power stations
wga-JPEWGzA,207360,210480,but to Target refineries and the Nexus
wga-JPEWGzA,210480,213480,points where lots of Russian pipelines
wga-JPEWGzA,213480,215459,come together to a single facility for
wga-JPEWGzA,215459,216840,redistribution
wga-JPEWGzA,216840,219239,there are a number of refineries
wga-JPEWGzA,219239,221879,throughout the Russian space we've got a
wga-JPEWGzA,221879,223140,map attached to show you the biggest
wga-JPEWGzA,223140,225780,ones but the one facility that I want to
wga-JPEWGzA,225780,227220,draw the most attention to is the city
wga-JPEWGzA,227220,228599,of Samara
wga-JPEWGzA,228599,231840,Samara is a pipeline Nexus and refining
wga-JPEWGzA,231840,233640,Center for pretty much all of the
wga-JPEWGzA,233640,235379,Russian stuff that comes in from South
wga-JPEWGzA,235379,237599,Central Siberia as well as in
wga-JPEWGzA,237599,239640,todderstone and bashqiristan and a lot
wga-JPEWGzA,239640,241440,of the oil projects that the Russians
wga-JPEWGzA,241440,243959,have that are not subject to some of the
wga-JPEWGzA,243959,245940,constraints that they have in the
wga-JPEWGzA,245940,248459,permafrost if you shut down an oil field
wga-JPEWGzA,248459,250439,in the permafrost you probably never
wga-JPEWGzA,250439,251939,start it up again because the pipes
wga-JPEWGzA,251939,253920,freeze from the inside but further south
wga-JPEWGzA,253920,257160,in bashqiristan and tartarstan that's a
wga-JPEWGzA,257160,259500,different picture it's not permafrost so
wga-JPEWGzA,259500,261060,the Russians can turn those on and off
wga-JPEWGzA,261060,263220,but if you remove Samara from the
wga-JPEWGzA,263220,265500,equation then Russia's ability to be
wga-JPEWGzA,265500,267180,flexible in anything that relates to
wga-JPEWGzA,267180,270300,energy including domestic supplies
wga-JPEWGzA,270300,273419,suddenly goes away that's the soft point
wga-JPEWGzA,273419,275759,in the Russian system and the ukrainians
wga-JPEWGzA,275759,276660,know it
wga-JPEWGzA,276660,281300,okay that's it for me until next time
